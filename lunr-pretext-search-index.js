  "body": " Real Numbers   Real numbers represented as are a set of numbers that include all rational and irrational numbers. They can be positive, negative, or zero, and can be represented on the number line. The table below shows classification of real numbers with examples.    Category  Examples    Whole numbers ( )      Integers( )     Fractions     Decimals     Irrational numbers        Real numbers do not include complex numbers like the square root of negative one .     We use real numbers in everyday life for tasks such as managing finances while budgeting or shopping, measuring ingredients for cooking, tracking time and distance when traveling, and interpreting data on digital devices.    Classifying whole numbers as odd, even, prime and composite in different situations  Whole numbers can be classified as odd, even, prime or composite based on their divisibility and factor properties.         Working in groups, write numbers from to .    Sort the numbers you wrote down into odd or even.    What patterns do you notice between even and odd numbers?    Identify prime and composite numbers from the list of even and odd numbers you have.    Discuss how a number is classified.    Identify prime numbers that are even.    Brainstorm a real life example where you can find odd, even, prime and composite numbers e.g pairs of shoes are even numbers.    Describe why classifying numbers in real-life could be useful.    Share your work with your fellow learners.           are numbers that are divisible by .   are numbers that when divided by two, you get a remainder.      We can only talk about even and odd numbers if they are integers (i.e., elements of ).     The sum or difference of two even numbers is even.  Example: and .    The sum or difference of two odd numbers is even.  Example: and     The sum or difference of an even and an odd number is always odd.  Example: and     When two odd integers are multiplied, the result is always an odd number.  Example:      When two even integers are multiplied, the result is an even number.  Example:      An even number multiplied by an odd number equals an even number.  Example:         A number is even if it ends with one of the digits:   A number is odd if it ends with one of the digits:    This method works only for integers (whole numbers, including zero and negatives).    Classify the following numbers as even or odd:                                          is an odd number since its last digit is .     is an even number since its last digit is .     is an odd number since its last digit is .     is an even number since its last digit is .     is an even number since its last digit is .     is an odd number since it ends with .         Kirui has cows in his farm and wants to group them equally into pens. Will each pen have an equal number of cows? Explain using even and odd number properties.    First we identify whether is even or odd.  Since the last digit is , this makes is an odd number.  An odd number cannot be divided evenly into equal groups.  The best we can do in this case is to divide the cows into two groups: one with cows and the other cows. This means it's not possible to split the cows evenly across all pens.          Classify the following numbers as even or odd using the given criterion.                                                List all the numbers between and and identify odd and even number from the range.    Find the sum of the first numbers and determine if the result is odd or even.    A grade class has students and their class teacher wanted to group them in pairs. Will each group have an equal number of students? Explain using odd or even properties.        Mutula is organizing a party, and he has party hats. Can Mutula arrange the hats in rows where each row has the same number of hats? What does this tell you about the number ?      is a number that has only two factors, that is, and itself. Example:    of a number is a natural number that divides it exactly with no remainder.  For example, is not a prime number because it has more than two factors: and . That is, and .  To identify if a number is prime, check if the number has two factors: and itself.   are natural numbers greater than that have more than two factors.  Examples: . Hence and are composite numbers since they have more than factors.  To identify if a number is composite, check if the number has more than two factors. In other words, if it can be divided exactly by numbers other than 1 and itself, then it is a composite number.  Examples:      is composite because and .     is composite because and .     is composite because and        and are neither prime nor composite.     Every composite number has prime factors. That is, it can be broken down into a product of prime numbers.  This helps reinforce the idea of prime factorization, which is a key property of composite numbers.     The only even prime number is .    All other even numbers greater than are composite.    The smallest composite number is .    Odd composite numbers are odd natural numbers greater than that are not prime (e.g., .     Think of prime numbers as building blocks, and composite numbers as being made by combining those blocks.    Which of the following numbers are prime and which are composite?                                          has no factors other than and itself.  Hence is a prime number.     meaning it is divisible by both and . it is also divisible by and itself.  Therefore, is a composite number.     cannot be divided by any number other than and itself.  This means that is a prime number.     which implies that and are its factors. Also, it is divisible by and itself, and , and .  Therefore, is a composite number     has no factors other than and itself, making it a prime number.     meaning has other factors other than and .  Hence is a composite number.

Use divisibility rules or the factorization method to determine whether it is a prime or composite number.    A teacher writes a two-digit number on the board. The number is prime and ends with . List all possible numbers it could be.    A marathon is divided into -kilometer relay sections. Each runner must cover a distance (in km) that is a composite number. List three possible distances a runner could cover.    A class of students forms a rectangular grid. The total number of students is . Determine whether this number is prime or composite and explain your reasoning.    If a number is divisible by and , what smallest composite number could it be?       Classifying real numbers as rational and irrational in different situations         Working in groups, choose any set of natural numbers between and (e.g., )   Use these numbers to create at least two fractions:  One proper fraction (e.g., )  One improper fraction (e.g., )    Use a calculator to divide each of your fractions.  Write down the decimal value of each.  Example: .    Choose any set of Natural numbers between and .  Write each number as a square root.  Example: (a rational number), (an irrational number).    Classify each number you have created (fractions, decimals, and square roots) as either rational or irrational.    What do you notice about the decimal form of rational numbers compared to irrational numbers?  Are there any patterns?    Discuss your observations with your fellow learners.            A rational number is any number that can be written as a fraction where and are integers and .  Example:     An irrational number is any number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two intergers.  Example:     consists of positive whole numbers, negative whole numbers and .   The decimal representation of a rational number either terminates (stops at some point) or repeats (continues but has a repeating pattern).  Example:    The decimal representation of an irrational number neither terminates (does not stop) nor repeats (continues without a repeated pattern).  Example:    The square root of a perfect square is a rational number.  Example: and can be written as    The square root of an imperfect square is an irrational number.  Example: which is an irrational number.        Rule: Check if the number is an integer or a fraction with an integer as the numerator and the denominator. If it is, then it is a rational number.  Example: or are both rational numbers because they are either whole numbers or simple fractions.    Rule: \"If the number is in decimal form, check if the decimal stops at some point. If it stops then the number is a rational number.\"  Example: is rational because the decimal terminates.    Rule: If the number is in decimal form, check if the decimal continues. If it continues with a repeated pattern then the number is a rational number and if it continues without a pattern then it is irrational.  Example (rational): (repeating)  xample (irrational): (no pattern)    Rule: \"If the number is expressed as a square root, find the square root of the number first and identify if it is a perfect or an imperfect square. If it is a perfect square (results to a whole number) then it is rational and if it is an imperfect square, then it is irrational.  Example (rational):   xample (irrational):             Working in groups, write any numbers between and (e.g., )    Form at least fractions using the numbers you formed above. Form both proper and improper fractions e.g., .    Divide each of the fractions you formed to express it as a decimal. Example: .    Express the numbers to as square roots. Example: .    Classify the fractions, decimals, and square root numbers you have formed as rational and irrational numbers.    What do you notice about the decimal forms of fractions?    Discuss your work with fellow learners.         Identify if the following numbers are rational or irrational.                                    Since is defined as .  We check if the decimal continues.  Hence is irrational because its decimal continues without having a repeated pattern.    Since is a fraction, we check if the fraction consist of integers with the denominator not equal to zero.  Therefore is a rational number.    To identify if is rational or irrational, we check the decimal.  A rational number can have a terminating decimal or a repeating decimal. In this case, the decimal terminates, so the number is rational    For , first we find its value.      has decimal which continues without a repeated pattern.  Hence is irrational.    The value of    is a fraction with integers on the numerator and the denominator.  Therefore, is rational.         Joy is designing a square garden. She measures the total area of the garden to be square meters and wants to find the length of one side. What is the exact length of one side of the garden? Classify the answer as a rational or irrational number.    Area of the garden =   To find the length of one side of the square, we take the square root of its area.  Side length = .  Simplifying the side length .  Since an irrational number, multiplying it by still gives an irrational number.

Use a calculator to determine the reciprocal and explain what it represents.  5. A car travels kilometers on liter of fuel. Use a calculator to find out liters of fuel needed per kilometer.  6. Write down numbers and work out their reciprocals using a calculator.     Using reciprocals of real numbers in mathematical computations  This is application of the concept of reciprocals to perform different types of mathematical operations such as division, solving equations, proportions, rates, and real-life problem-solving.      In groups, find an exercise book and a pen.  1. Write different numbers (that is positive, negative, decimal numbers and fractions) on the exercise book.  Example:   2. Find the reciprocals of the numbers you have formed.  Example: Number formed is its reciprocal is given by   3. Multiply the original number you formed by its corresponding reciprocal and observe the result.  Example:   4. Discuss cases where reciprocals do not exist.  5. Identify a real world problem where reciprocals are useful.  6. Share your work with fellow learners.          Converting Division into Multiplication  Instead of dividing a number, we multiply by the reciprocal: .  Example with whole numbers:     Example with fractions:       Solving Equations  When solving equations where a variable is multiplied by a number, we use the reciprocal to isolate the variable.  Example: Solve for in the equation   To solve for , multiply both sides by the reciprocal of .  Therefore,     Working with proportions and ratios while cooking.  Example: If a recipe uses of a cup of sugar per serving, how many servings can you make with cups?  To find the number of servings, compute:        Real-World applications like determining speed and time.  Example: If a car moves at km\/h, to determine how long it takes to travel km, we use reciprocal.  Therefore to travel km we take the reciprocal of speed which is hours per km.       Kerich is a farmer and has of an acre of land and wants to divide it into plots of acre each. How many plots can Kerich make?    To find the number of plots that Kerich can make, we solve it as a division problem.  Divide by and solve it by multiplying by the reciprocal of as below:     Hence Kerich can make plots.      Njoki, a business woman invest ksh in a business that promises to double his investment every years. What fraction of her initial investment will she have after years?    If years times the initial investment, how about years?  Computing the number of times her investment will yield after years we have:      This means her investment will double times.  Therefore, after years her investment will be         Representing the number of years with their corresponding double investment in ksh makes it easier to understand the above computations.

The population of a town increases by every year. How many years will it take for the population to triple?    Kingvalley bank offers interest rate per year. A customer earns ksh interest in one year. What was the original deposit?    A hiker is walking km and takes breaks every km. How many breaks will he take by the end of the journey? If he changes his break interval to km, how does the number of breaks change?    A road is km long and is divided into equal segments of km for maintenance. How many segments are there?       Real-world applications of reciprocals of real numbers  Reciprocals are important in various fields, including finance, science, engineering, medicine, and transportation . In disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and manufacturing, dividing rational numbers using reciprocals helps solve real-world problems, from calculating speed and time to determining chemical concentrations and optimizing production efficiency.  In this section, we will explore real-world applications of reciprocals and how they make mathematical computations easier and more practical.      Nkirote is a baker and is preparing large orders of bread for a grade student's event. Each batch of bread requires kg of flour, and she has a total of kg of flour. She needs to determine how many full batches she can make. As she prepares, she realizes that each batch also requires liters of milk. If she has liters of milk available, she must check whether she has enough for all the batches. To ensure efficiency, she calculates how many full loaves of bread she can produce if each batch yields of a loaf per kilogram of flour used.  1. Working in groups, use reciprocals to determine how many full batches of bread the baker can make with kg of flour.  2. Calculate whether liters of milk is enough for all the batches.  3. If each batch produces of a loaf per kilogram of flour, how many full loaves can she make?  4. How was reciprocal helpful in dividing quntities while baking?  5. Discuss areas where reciprocals are applied in the real word.  6. Discuss your work with fellow learners.       Here are practical examples of how reciprocals are applied to solve real-world problems:  1. A printing machine can print of a book page per second. How long will it take to print pages?  If second = of a page, then for pages, we calculate as follows:     Multiplying and simplifying we have: Time = seconds.  Thus, the printing machines will take seconds to print pages.  2. If a car travels at km\/h, to find out the time taken per km we can use reciprocal.  Time per km = hours per km.  3. If a factory produces items in hours, then the production rate per hour is:   items per hour.  To determine how much time is needed per item, we use reciprocal:  Hence, the factory produces item every hours.    Okoth runs miles in an hour. What is her speed in miles per hour?    To find speed we divide distance by time such that: speed = .  First, we need to convert the fraction into an improper fraction which is   Hence, speed =   Multiply by the reciprocal of .     Simplifying we get which is .       1. A paint manufacturer claims that liter of paint covers square feet. A customer buys a -liter sample and uses it to paint a -foot by -foot section of a wall. To determine whether the sample meets the manufacturer's claim, first calculate the area it covers. Then, using reciprocals, find how many times liters fits into liter. Compare the result with the stated square feet per liter to determine if the sample performs as expected.  2. A gardener can plant of a flowerbed per hour. How long will it take to complete flowerbeds?  3. A printer in a publishing company prints of a book page per second. How long will it take to print pages at this rate?  4. A car consumes of a gallon of fuel per mile. If the fuel tank holds gallons, how many miles can the car travel before running out of fuel?  5. A construction crew is tasked with laying concrete on a road section. A -ton cement truck can produce enough concrete to cover square meters. However, due to supply limitations, only tons of cement is available. Using reciprocals, determine how many square meters can be covered with tons of cement.  6. A laboratory is preparing a specialized chemical solution. The standard formula states that liters of a concentrated acid can be diluted to produce liters of usable solution. If the lab technician only has liters of the concentrate, use reciprocals to calculate how many liters of usable solution can be prepared.  7. A group of workers can complete of a construction task in hours. How much time will it take to finish the entire task at the same rate?   "

  "body": " Indices and Logarithms   Indices   Introduction  Mathematics involves working with very large and very small numbers, which can be simplified using indices. An (plural, ) also called or is a way of writing repeated multiplication of the same number.   Why Are Indices Important?   Indices are widely used in:     Scientific notation writing, where numbers are sometimes very large and sometimes very small, such as the speed of light or the size of an atom.    Physics and Engineering to understand exponential growth and decay rates, such as radioactive decay and population growth.    Finance and money in calculating compound interest.       Expressing Numbers in Index Form  Numbers can be written in different ways. One useful way is index notation also called exponential notation. Index notation, is a way of writing repeated multiplication of the same number.  Exponent is commonly known as the power .    Work in groups:    Materials Needed: One sheet of paper per student. A piece of paper is approimately. mm thick   Instruction:   Form groups of students each. A piece of paper is approximately. mm thick     Take a piece of paper and fold it in half once. Count the number of layers.    Fold it in half again and count the number of layers.    Continue folding and record your observations in a table.    Express the number of layers using index notation.      Table Showing the Growth of Paper Thickness with Each Fold    Number of Folds  Thickness (mm)  Index Notation    0 (no fold)  0.1 mm     1 fold  0.2 mm     2 folds  0.4 mm     3 folds  ?  ?    4 folds  ?  ?    5 folds  ?  ?        What pattern do you observe in the numbers of layers?    Can you express the pattern using indices?    If you could fold the paper 10 times, how thick would it be?    Can you think of other situations where things double repeatedly?      When writing Index Notation we represent it as:     Where:   is the base (the number being multiplied).   is the (the number of times the base is multiplied by itself).  Therefore given as a whole number;   .......( is the number of times is repeated)   Example:    = ( repeated twice)   = ( repeated thrice)      = ( repeated four times)      Expressing Whole Numbers in Index Form   Load the question by clicking the button below.

He divides his rectangular field into smaller equal plots. The total area of the field is , and each small plot has an area of . How many smaller plots does Mr. Gitonga get? Express your answer using indices.      Mkurugenzi Company investments grows exponentially. It was initially worth Kenyan shillings, but after two years, it was multiplied by . Use indices to represent the total investment value after the two years.      Mathematics department has books that can be borrowed and the science section has books. Write an index expression for the total number of books in both sections if they were combined into a single shelf.      A carpenter is building square tables of different sizes. The first table he makes has an area of square metres. Each new table he builds is twice the length of the previous one.     Express the area of the second and third tables in index form.    Using the Laws of Indices, find the total area of the first three tables combined.    If the carpenter continues doubling the table size, what will be the area of the table?          Zero and Negative Indices  Indices help us simplify repeated multiplication of the same number. But what happens when the exponent is zero or negative?   Zero Indices (Zero Exponent\/Power Zero Law)      Material needed:      Pen and paper    A calculator      Instructions:   Look at the pattern below and complete the missing values:                 From the activity;     What pattern do you notice as the exponent decreases by ?    What happens when the exponent reaches zero?    Can you try the same pattern with ?      Key Takeaway:   Any non-zero number raised to power zero is always .  i.e =      Negative Indices     Look at the pattern below and complete the missing values:                       Write the answers as fractions and decimal values.    What do you notice about the negative exponents?    Can you try the same pattern using ?      Key Takeaway:   A negative exponent means taking the reciprocal of the base.  i.e =      Discussion:      What do zero and negative indices represent, and how do they simplify expressions?    How do negative exponents help express very small values and implify small numbers?    Why does any nonzero number raised to power zero equal ? What happens when the base is zero?    Where do we see numbers decreasing exponentially or repeated division in real life?       The school need to make desks for grade students. A carpenter is cutting wooden planks for the desks. The length of each plank decreases by half as he cuts smaller sections.   Plank Lengths and Index Notation    Cut Number  Plank Length (metres)  Index Notation    Original Plank      First Cut  __     Second Cut  __     Third Cut  __       Hint: The negative exponent represents how many times the length has been halved.    Each cut divides the plank by :     The original plank is metre    The first cut halves the plank:       The second cut halves it again:       The third cut follows the same pattern:     If represents the number of cuts, the remaining plank length follows a trend which can bw represented as:     where:   = number of cuts   = remaining length after cuts     Using this formula, let's calculate the length after cuts:     After cuts, the remaining plank length is metres   Key Takeaway   ✔ Negative indices represent repeated division.  ✔ This pattern appears in real-life situations like paper folding, battery energy life, and population decay.

Since the population doubles every years, we observe the following:     After years → = people    After years → = people    After years → = people     Instead of calculating step by step, we can use indices.  Since the population doubles every years, we use the exponential growth model:     Where:      = population after years     = Initial population      = number of years years    The base represents doubling every years     Therefore:     Since we simplify:     We now calculate ;     Now,        In years time, the town's population will be people     Population Growth Model Using Indices   Load the question by clicking the button below.

Express this in index notation.           Logarithms   Why Logarithms?  In the previous section, indices allowed us to simplify very large or small numbers by expressing them in terms of powers. However, there are situations where we need to reverse this process, rather than finding the result of a power, we need to determine the exponent itself. This is where logarithms come into play.  A is the inverse of an exponent (index). It tells us the power to which a specific base must be raised to produce a given number.  For example:  Exponent Form:   Logarithm Form:   In simpler terms, a answers the question: \"To what power must the base be raised to produce a certain number?\"   Why Are Logarithms Important?   Logarithms are crucial for solving equations involving exponents. They simplify computations and are widely used in fields like:      Finance: calculating compound interest or investment growth.     Science and Engineering: understanding radioactive decay, measuring sound intensity, or modeling population growth.       Logarithms notation     Work in groups: Form groups of students   Materials: A Paper\/book and a pen   Instructions:   Pick a number from the set: or   Break down the chosen number into its prime factors.  Start by dividing the number by its smallest prime factor repeatedly until only prime factors remain.   e.g.       Express your final result in index form  Reflect on how the indices relate to logarithms:  For example, translates to      Key Takeaway:   Logarithms are simply another way of expressing indices.

Using Logarithms with Standard Form  Standard form is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in a more manageable format. It is expressed as:     Where:      is a number between and       is an integer (positive for large numbers and negative for small numbers)        Work in groups: Form groups of students   Instruction:      Write any five digit number in your book    Identify the first non-zero digit from the left.    Place a decimal point after this digit.    Count how many places the decimal has moved;     If moved left, the exponent is positive.    If moved right, the exponent is negative.       Express the number in the form         Examples:      The distance from the Earth to the Sun is approximately        The size of a red blood cell is about m         Further Activity:      The population of Kenya is approximately . Express this number in standard form.    The size of a human hair is about metres. Express the length in standard form.    The charge of an electron is coulombs. Convert this to standard form.      Finding Logarithms of Numbers in Standard Form:     Find                In this case is the characteristic . The characteristic is the whole number part of a logarithm. It tells us how large or small the number is based on powers of .   is the mantissa . The mantissa is the decimal part of the logarithm, found using logarithm tables. It depends on the significant digits of the number but is always positive.   Key Takeaway:      For numbers greater than , the characteristic is one less than the number of digits before the decimal point.    For numbers less than , the characteristic is negative, often written in bar notation (e.g instead of ).

  "body": " Quadratic Expressions and Equations 1   In this section, we will explore quadratic expressions and equations, which are important concepts in algebra. Quadratics might sound complicated, but they are actually all around us, and learning how to work with them will make solving many kinds of problems much easier. We will start by understanding what quadratic expressions and equations are and how they relate to real-life situations, like calculating areas. You will also learn different ways to solve these equations, such as factorization. By the end, you will not only know how to solve quadratic equations but also understand how they apply to everyday problems.     Define quadratic expressions and equations.    Derive quadratic identities from the concept of area.    Solve quadratic equations by factorization.    Derive quadratic formula and use it to solve quadratic equations.    Form quadratic equations different in different situations.    Explore use of quadratic equations in real life situations.         Quadratic Expressions     Work in Groups.      Identify and label the terms of the quadratic expression: quadratic term, linear term , and constant term .    Discuss whether the expression is in standard form and, if not, try to convert it.    Solve the quadratic equation.    Discuss the properties of the expression: whether it can be solved, whether it has real solutions, etc.    Examples of quadratic expressions:                Identify the coefficients and constants.    Present your findings to the class.      By the end of this subsection, we will learn how to form quadratic expressions from different scenarios, simplify them, and use them in various real-life applications. By the end, you should be able to recognize quadratic expressions in different situations and form them based on the given conditions.  A quadratic expression is an expression of the form: where;     and are constants (real numbers).     is a variable (what we look for or finding), and     beacuse if , it would not be a quadratic expression.     In the previous grades you learned about algebraic expressions  An expression of the form; is called a monomial expression   A monomial expression is a an expression with one term.  A binomial expression is an expression with two terms ie.    Expressions can be formed in various ways;   Multiplying an expresssion with one term ( monmial ) with an expression with two terms ( a binomial )    Multiplying two expression with two terms ( two binomials ).       Multiplying a monomial by a binomial.    Work in Groups   The following data represents the multiplication of a monomial by a binomial. Copy the table and complete it.                            Multiply the monomial by each binomial using the distributive property. For example, for , distribute across the binomial and simplify.   What do you notice about the process of multiplying a monomial by a binomial?    How do you apply the distributive property when multiplying terms?    Can you create your own examples of a monomial multiplied by a binomial and solve them?    How can you simplify the expressions after distributing the monomial?    Discuss in your group how the distributive property allows you to break down the multiplication step-by-step.       Key Takeaway  When multiplying a monomial by a binomial, you apply the distributive property, multiplying the monomial by each term in the binomial, then combining like terms if necessary.       Simplify:     Opening the brackets      Collecting like terms we form a quadratic expression:     From the example above you can see that;   are the monomial expressions while are the binomial expression.       Simplify the following expressions to form a quadratic expression.     Opening the brackets: Collecting like terms: Simplifying:        Form a quadratic equation using the following terms:                                                                                                                 Multipling Two Binomials.

Can you think of any real-world applications where you might use perfect square identities?      A Perfect Square is a special kind of trinomial that can be factored into the square of a binomial. There are two forms of perfect square identities:             In these identities, the expression on the left is a perfect square, which means it can be written as the square of a binomial (a two-term expression). The first identity is used when the middle term is positive, and the second identity is used when the middle term is negative.

Can you think of any real-world scenarios where factoring is useful (e.g., optimizing areas, engineering problems)?      Factoring quadratic expressions involves expressing a quadratic equation in the form of two binomials. A general quadratic equation looks like: To factor a quadratic, we find two numbers and such that:    (the product of and ),     (the coefficient of )   Once we find and , we break the middle term into two terms using and , then factor by grouping.

The product of the constant terms in the factors is equal to the constant term in the expression.         Factorise the following expression:     In this case, the coefficient of is one, the coefficient of is 5 and the constant term is 6.

The general form of a quadratic expression is , where , and are constants.  In this section we are going to discuss how to factorise a quadratic expression when the in is not equal to .  Consider the following identities:                                              From the above examples, we can see that the factorisation of a quadratic expression when the coefficient of is not one is similar to the factorisation of a quadratic expression when the coefficient of is one.  Factors are multiplied to get the final expresions on the righthand side (RHS) of the equations.     Given the quadratic expressions on the right-hand side of the equation, how can you be able factor them?   Consider the expression .

In this case is the coefficient of and is constant term.    Their sum is , where is the coefficient of .  The terms are and        Rewrite the term as the sum of the two numbers found in step (i)(b) .  Thus,                Factorise the expression .

Any equation of the form where are constants and is known as a quadratic equation. In this section, solutions of quadratic equations using the factor method is discussed.  To solve a quadratic equation by factorisation, we aim to rewrite the quadratic equation in the form of: where and are numbers that, when multiplied, give the product (the constant term), and when added, give the sum (the coefficient of the middle term).  To solve a quadratic eaquation, first ensure the equations is in the form; if not in the form rearrange, so that all terms are on one side of the equation and the equation equals zero.  Factor the quadratic expression:   Look for two numbers that when multiplied give (the coefficient of )    And, when added give (the coefficient of the middle term).

The factors are .   Now create common factors Grouping them together we have:         Form a quadratic expression using the factoring method.     To form a quadratic expression using the factoring method, first set the expression equal to to form a quadratic equation:   Remove the common factor out and form a bracket:   Thus, the factored form of expression is;           Form a quadratic expression using the following expressions.

In our previous sections we have discussed the form of a quadratic expression, identities and quadratic equations; how to form quadratic equations and differentiate between an expression and equation  In this section we are going to learn about solving the factored equation, we are going to continue from the point where we form factored equation  Numbers that satisfy an equation (its solutions) are called the roots of the equation.  Once you have factored the quadratic into the form; Set each factor equal to zero and solve for :             Solving these will give the two solutions for .      Solve     Look for two numbers that if multiplied by and when added up gives   These numbers are and So we can write the equation as: Finding a common factor we have: Grouping we have th factors of the equation as:   Setting each factor equal to zero (0).

Form and solve a quadratic equation to find the dimensions of the garden.           Application Of Quadratic Equations To Real Life Situations.   Quadratic equations are a type of mathematical equation that can be used to describe many different real-life situations. Whether you're throwing a ball in the air, trying to maximize the area of a garden, or calculating profits for a business, quadratic equations can help solve problems that involve relationships with squared terms.  In this section, we will learn how to recognize real-life situations that can be modeled by quadratic equations, how to set them up, and how to solve them step by step.  A quadratic equation is an equation that can be written in the form: where,    , and are real numbers or constants,     is the unknown variable    and beacuse if is it would npt be a quadratic     Quadratic equations show up in many situations, especially when something is changing in a way that involves squares (like height, area, or profit).  Lets take a look at some of the situations Quadratic Equations is involved in real life situations.      projectile   One of the most common real-life situations for quadratic equations is projectile motion , such as when you throw a ball in the air. The height of the ball over time can be described by a quadratic equation.      A rock is dropped from a height of meters. Its height above the ground at time is given by Use factorization to determine how long it will take for the rock to reach the ground.    The height of the rock above the ground is given by:   To find when the rock reaches the ground, set :   Simplify the equation:    Solve for :   Since time cannot be negative, .  Therefore, the rock will take approximately seconds to reach the ground.       Quadratic equations are also used in optimization problems. These are problems where you want to maximize or minimize something, like the area of a garden.      The length of a rectangle is meters more than its width. If the area of the rectangle is square meters, find the dimensions of the rectangle by factoring the quadratic equation.   optimization problems     Let the width of the rectangle be . Then the length is .  The area of the rectangle is given by:   Expand and rearrange into standard quadratic form:   Factorize the quadratic equation:   Solve for :   Since width cannot be negative, .  The dimensions of the rectangle are: Since the width cannot be negative, the width is meters, and lenght is meters.       Businesses often use quadratic equations to model their profit. For example, the profit a company makes from selling a product can be modeled by a quadratic equation.      A company's profit from selling units of a product is given by the equation: Find how many units the company needs to sell to have no profit (i.e., when the profit is zero).    To find when the company has no profit, set :   Multiply through by to simplify:   Factorize the quadratic equation:   Solve for :   Therefore, the company will have no profit when it sells either units or units.       A stone is thrown into the air from a height of meters with an initial velocity of meters per second. The height of the stone at time is given by: Find when the stone reaches the ground.      A farmer has meters of fencing. He wants to build a rectangular garden. The length is meters longer than the width. What should the dimensions be to maximize the area?      A school's profit function is given by: Find the number of units the company must sell to achieve zero profit.      A water fountain shoots water into the air, and its height at any time (in seconds) is given by the equation: Find the time it will take for the water to return to the ground (i.e., when ).      Solve the following quadratic equation: Find the value of       A company finds that the revenue it generates from selling units of a product is given by the quadratic equation: Find the number of units that the company needs to sell to maximize its revenue.      The path of a car is represented by the quadratic equation where represents time in seconds and represents the car's position. Find the time when the car reaches its starting position by factorizing the equation.      "

The process of obtaining triangle from triangle is known as     Triangle is said to be object and triangle , its image under enlargement.The point is known as the     To determine the scale factor, divide the length of the enlarged image by the corresponding length of the original object.              Enlargement is a transformation that increases the size of a shape. The shape is enlarged by a scale factor. The scale factor is used to multiply the length of each side of the shape to get the length of the corresponding side of the enlarged shape.    In an enlargement, the object and its image remain similar. The linear scale factor of the enlargement determines the proportional transformation.    Lines connecting object points to their corresponding image points intersect at the center of enlargement. This property helps in determining the center of enlargement when both the object and its image are given.

  "body": " Reflection and Congruence    Identifying Lines of Symmetry Given an Object   Work in groups    From a piece of paper, cut out a square shape and label it as shown below.   Square    Fold the square in half from left to right such that the corner aligns with corner and corner aligns with corner This will create a rectangle.  Unfold the paper and make a dotted line across the fold line and label it as as shown.   Square    Notice that the left side of the line and the right side are exacly the same\/ identical.  Now, fold the square in half from the top to the bottom such that the corner aligns with corner and corner aligns with corner This will create another rectangle.  Unfold the paper and make a dotted line across the second fold line and label it as as shown.   Square    Again, you notice that the upper side of the line and the lower side are exacly the same\/ identical.  Next, fold the paper in half from the bottom left corner to the top right corner This creates a triangle.  Unfold the paper, you will notice that a fold line appears along Trace a dotted line along the fold line as showm.   Square    Finally, fold the paper in half from the top left corner to the bottom right corner This creates another triangle.  Now, unfold the paper, you will notice that a fold line appears along Trace a dotted line along the fold line as showm.   Square     Key Takeaway   There are four dotted lines Both sides of each line are exactly the same.  Therefore symmetry is when an object\/shape looks exactly similar or identical on one side and the other side when the object is folded\/flipped, rotated or reflected.  The four dotted lines are known are the lines of symmetry. Therefore, a square has lines of symmetry.  A line of symmetry divides an object or shape into similar\/ identical parts, that is, one half is the mirror image of the other half.     Find the number of lines of symmetry in the equialteral triangle below.       An equilateral triangle has lines of symmetry each one from the vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side as shown.          Cut out the following shapes from a paper and find the number of lines of symmetry in each.                              Identify lines of symmetry in the alphabetical letters below   alphabets     alphabets-2     alphabets-3       Identify lines of symmetry on the different objects in your classroom and at home.       Plane of Symmetry    Work in groups   Consider the activity below illustrating plane of symmetry of a cube.                                    There are planes of symmetry in a cube as you can see in the images above.      vertical planes of symmetry.     horizontal plane of symmetry.     diagonal planes of symmetry.       Key Takeaway    Plane of symmetry is an imaginary flat surface that divides an object into two equal halves, such that one half is the mirror image of the other half.  When you cut a banana vertically into two equal halves such that one half is the reflection of the other half, you create a plane of symmetry of the banana.    How many planes of symmetry does a square based pyramid have?       A square based pyramid has planes of symmetry as shown below.                     How many planes of symmetry are there in the following geometrical objects.     Sphere.    Triangular prism.    Rectangular prism.    Cone.    Cylinder.         Find planes of symmetry for objects around the school.      Identify fruits and vegetables that have planes of symmetry.       Properties of Reflection      Work in groups   Exploring reflections with mirrors.   Needed Materials      A small mirror.    Marker or pencil.    Piece of paper.      Steps.      Hold your hand about in front of the mirror, with your palm facing the mirror. What do you notice?   Hand     Turn your hand so that the back of your hand faces the mirror instead. Observe again. How does the reflection mimic the shape of your hand? Is there symmetry between your hand and its relection?    Hold your hand in front of the mirror with your palm facing the mirror, then fold your fingers to make a fist. Does the reflection mimic your hand movements in the same direction?    Slowly rotate your hand in different directions (up, down, sideways) while watching the mirror. Discuss how the mirror's reflection always mirrors the real movement.    Move your hand closer to the mirror until it touches the mirror. What do you notice?      Key Takeaway      The mirror does not create a random image but produces a reversed copy of the object in front of it. From your activity, you will notice that when you hold your right hand in front of the mirror, the reflection is a reverse which appers as the left hand. This phenomena is called lateral inversion. Lateral inversion is when a reflected object appears to be flipped along a vertical axis.    You will also notice that the reflection mimics you hand movements when you flip, rotate it and when you fold it.    As you move your hand closer to the mirror, you notice that the distance between reflection and the mirror reduces. When you touch the mirror, the image appears to touch your hand. Your hand and its reflection are in symmetry.          Identify the parts of your body are the mirror images of one another.      Draw a letter on a paper using a marker. Show it to the mirror. Observe how the mirror flips the image.      What other surface reflects images other than a mirror?       Reflection of Different Shapes on a Plane    Work in groups   Here is a step by step approach on reflection of a triangle on a plane      Draw a perpendicular line from vertex to the mirror line and measure the distance by counting the number of squares between vertex and the mirror line Repeat this process for vertices      Determine the position of the reflected vertices. For vertex the perpendicular distance between the vertex and the mirror line is squares. Count squares from the mirror line to the opposite side of the mirror line and mark that point as which is the reflected image of vertex Repeat the same procedure the remaining vertices      Connect the reflected vertices to create the reflected image of the triangle    Reflected triangle       Draw the image of the pentagon under the reflaction on the diagonal mirror line        To obtain the image of draw a perpendicular line from to the mirro line extend the line the same distance on the opposite side of the mirror line and mark the point as Similarly, obtain the images the images of vertices respectively.  Connect the images of the vertices to form the reflection of the pentagon.        Key Takeaway      Reflection moves the image of an object across the mirror line, that is, to the opposite side of the mirror line.    A point on the object is the same distance as its reflection from the mirror line.    The line connecting a point to its image is perpendicular to the mirror line. Therefore, the mirror line is the perpendicular bisector of the lines connecting the object points and the image points.        Copy the figures below and draw their images under the reflection on the mirror line                  Reflect the object about the y-axis         The vertices of a polygon are given as: A(-5,5), B(-6,3), C(-5,1), D(-3,0), E(-2,2) and F(-3,4). Find the image of the polygon under the following reflection lines:      followed by               The points are the images of points respectively under a reflection on the line Find the coordinates for points        Determining the Equation of a Mirror Line ( Line of Reflection) Given an Object and its Image    Work in groups   Determine the line of reflection that created the reflected image below.   Line of reflection    Copy the figure above on a graph paper  Fold your graph paper such that the points of the objects match with their respective images. Where does the fold line appear?   Key Takeaway      You notice that the fold line appears exactly on the y-axis. Therefore, the line of reflection is the y-axis.    A line of reflection can be defined with there equation. From the activity, the equation of the line of reflection is         Determine the equation of the line of reflection.   Line of reflection      The coordinates of are at tells you that the line of reflection passes through   Connect point with a line. The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of   From the properties of reflection, the distance from the object to the mirror line is the same as that of mirror line to the image. Therefore, the line of reflection passes through the midpoint of the line connecting   Coordinates for and that of The mid point of line is:   Since you know that the line of reflection passes through the gradient of the reflection line is:   Therefore taking points the equation of the line of reflection is :           Determine if the transformation is a reflection. If it is a reflection, what is the equation of the mirror line?    Line of reflection     Line of reflection         The vertices of a triangle are The vertices of the image are Find the equation of the line of reflection.      The vertices of a a letter are The vertices of the image are Find the equation of the line of reflection.       is the centre of a circle of radius If is the reflection of the centre of the circle, find the equation of the line of reflection.       Congruence    Work in groups   Trace and cut out the following shapes on a piece of paper.      Match two shapes by aligning them directly on top of each other. Discuss how the sides and angles perfectly overlap.  Flip one shape (like turning it over) and try to align it with another shape. Discuss how the shapes still match in size and angles, even though one is flipped.     Identify the figures with the same shape.    Identify the figures with the same size.    Identify figure with same size and shape.      Key Takeaway      Figure with the same size and shape are said to be congruent.     The symbol for congruence is For example, in your activity,     Also, fits directly on without flipping, thus are said to be directly congruent. Identify other figures that are directly congruent.     do not fit directly but when you flip (lateral inversion) figure and fit it on they align. This is called opposite congruence. Identify other figure that have opposite congruence from your activity.    Figures with the same shape but different size are said to be similar.     Congruence can also be applied to line segments and angles.        Here is an example of congruent polygons.          Identify figures that are:     Directly congruent.    Oppositely congruent.    Similar.            Identify object around your school that have axis of symmetry and state the order of rotational symmetry.       Congruence Tests for Triangles     Work in groups   Conditions for Congruence in Triangles   Materials      Construction paper    Pencil, ruler, protractor      Instructions   Trace the following triangles on a construction paper.                                      Identify pairs of congruent triangles.  From the pairs of congruent triangles you have identified, which pairs fit the following criteria:     The three sides of one triangle is equal to the three sides of the corresponding triangle.    Two sides and an included angle of one triangle is equal to the two corresponding sides and the included angle of the other triangle.    One side and two included angles of one triangle is equal to the corresponding side and the two included angles of the other triangle.    One side and the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and the corresponding side of another right-angled triangle.      Key Takeaway   Congruence in triangles dependS on the measure of the sides and angles. Two triangles are said to be congruent if a pair of the corresponding sides and corresponding angles are equal.  Criteria for congruence tests in triangles include:      Side-side-side (SSS): the three sides of one triangle is equal to the three sides of the corresponding triangle.     Side-angle-side (SAS): two sides and an included angle of one triangle is equal to the two corresponding sides and the included angle of the other triangle.     Angle-side-angle (ASA): one side and two included angles of one triangle is equal to the corresponding side and the two included angles of the other triangle.     Right angle-hypotenuse-side (RHS): one side and the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and the corresponding side of another right-angled triangle.     Angle-angle-side (AAS): one side and two included angles of one triangle is equal to the corresponding side and the two included angles of the other triangle.         Check if the triangles below are congruent and state the test of congruence criterion.       From the figure, identify corresponding sides and angles.  Sides      Therefore, by SAS criterion       Check if the triangles below are congruent and state test of congruence criterion.         Show that if           are the coordinates of Reflect the triangle over mirror line Prove that the triangle and its image are congruent and state the test of congruence criterion.      Construct an equilateral triangle with sides is the midpoint of and is perpendicular to Show that State the test of congruence criterion.      "

Square    Finally, fold the paper in half from the top left corner to the bottom right corner This creates another triangle.  Now, unfold the paper, you will notice that a fold line appears along Trace a dotted line along the fold line as showm.   Square     Key Takeaway   There are four dotted lines Both sides of each line are exactly the same.  Therefore symmetry is when an object\/shape looks exactly similar or identical on one side and the other side when the object is folded\/flipped, rotated or reflected.  The four dotted lines are known are the lines of symmetry. Therefore, a square has lines of symmetry.  A line of symmetry divides an object or shape into similar\/ identical parts, that is, one half is the mirror image of the other half.  "

Hold your hand about in front of the mirror, with your palm facing the mirror. What do you notice?   Hand     Turn your hand so that the back of your hand faces the mirror instead. Observe again. How does the reflection mimic the shape of your hand? Is there symmetry between your hand and its relection?    Hold your hand in front of the mirror with your palm facing the mirror, then fold your fingers to make a fist. Does the reflection mimic your hand movements in the same direction?    Slowly rotate your hand in different directions (up, down, sideways) while watching the mirror. Discuss how the mirror's reflection always mirrors the real movement.    Move your hand closer to the mirror until it touches the mirror. What do you notice?      Key Takeaway      The mirror does not create a random image but produces a reversed copy of the object in front of it. From your activity, you will notice that when you hold your right hand in front of the mirror, the reflection is a reverse which appers as the left hand. This phenomena is called lateral inversion. Lateral inversion is when a reflected object appears to be flipped along a vertical axis.    You will also notice that the reflection mimics you hand movements when you flip, rotate it and when you fold it.    As you move your hand closer to the mirror, you notice that the distance between reflection and the mirror reduces. When you touch the mirror, the image appears to touch your hand. Your hand and its reflection are in symmetry.      "

Identify pairs of congruent triangles.  From the pairs of congruent triangles you have identified, which pairs fit the following criteria:     The three sides of one triangle is equal to the three sides of the corresponding triangle.    Two sides and an included angle of one triangle is equal to the two corresponding sides and the included angle of the other triangle.    One side and two included angles of one triangle is equal to the corresponding side and the two included angles of the other triangle.    One side and the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and the corresponding side of another right-angled triangle.      Key Takeaway   Congruence in triangles dependS on the measure of the sides and angles. Two triangles are said to be congruent if a pair of the corresponding sides and corresponding angles are equal.  Criteria for congruence tests in triangles include:      Side-side-side (SSS): the three sides of one triangle is equal to the three sides of the corresponding triangle.     Side-angle-side (SAS): two sides and an included angle of one triangle is equal to the two corresponding sides and the included angle of the other triangle.     Angle-side-angle (ASA): one side and two included angles of one triangle is equal to the corresponding side and the two included angles of the other triangle.

  "body": " Rotation      Have you ever watched the hands of a clock move, seen a merry-go-round spin, or noticed the Earth turning? These all involve rotation—the spinning of an object around a fixed point or axis. Rotation is everywhere!    When you ride a merry-go-round or ride a bicycle, the wheels rotate, making everything move smoothly. The Earth itself rotates, which gives us day and night. Even when you stir your drink, you're creating a small rotation!    Rotation is a transformation that moves an object around a fixed point but its size and shape are not changed. Rotations are sometimes called turns. The point around which a rotation occurs is called the centre of rotation, and the distance a shape turns is called the angle of rotation    In this lesson, we will explore the beauty of rotation, understand its principles, and see how it plays a role in everything.       Properties of Rotation      Work in pairs    Graph paper, a ruler, a protractor and a pencil.     On a graph paper, draw triangle and its image, triangle as shown in the figure below.         Pick a point on the graph to act as the centre of rotation. Mark this point          Using a ruler, draw a straight line from point to and also from point to as shown below. Measure the distance and and record your results. What do you notice?         Similarly, draw a straight line from point to and also from point to . Measure the distance and and record your results. What do you notice?         Finally, draw a straight line from point to and also from point to . Measure the distance and and record your results. What do you notice?         Now using a protractor, measure , and and record your results. What do you notice?        The distance , and   The distance from a point to the centre of rotation is the same as the distance from the image of that point to the centre of rotation.       The angle of rotation is the same for all points in the shape.  In this case, Point is the centre of rotation and angle is the angle of rotation.        A rotation in the anticlockwise direction is taken to be positive i.e a rotation of anticlockwise is     A rotation in the clockwise direction is taken to be negative i.e a rotation of clockwise is     In general, for a rotation to be completely defined, the centre and angle of rotation must be stated.         The coordinates of the vertices for triangle that can be graphed in the coordinate plane are , and as shown below. The triangle is rotated through in a clockwise direction about the origin to produce triangle .Copy the figure and draw triangle                       Centre and Angle of Rotation        Graph paper, a ruler, a protractor and a pencil     On a piece of graph paper draw triangle and its image as shown in the figure below.       Join point to and construct a perpendicular bisector to as shown below;       Similary Join point to and to and construct a perpendicular bisector to and as shown below;       Now join point to and and measusure     Similary join point to and and to and and measusure and . What do you notice?       Share your work with other leaners in class        Triangle is the image of triangle after a rotation.The centre and angle of rotation can be found by drawing the perpendicular bisectors of the lines between two sets of points, and and and or and   The point where two perpendicular bisectors intersect is called To find , join and to the centre of rotation and measure the angle between these lines.           In the figures below, the triangle is the image of triangle after rotation. Find the centre and angle of rotation       In order to determine the centre and angle of rotation we have to follow the following steps:     Join point to and construct a perpendicular bisector to as shown below       Also join point to and construct a perpendicular bisector to as shown below. Mark the point of intersection of perpendicular bisectors        Similary you can join to and construct a perpendicular bisector to    You can use only two points.  The point where perpendicular bisectors intersect is the centre of rotation.    Now join and to the centre of rotation . Measure using a protractor.        Centre of rotation   Angle of rotation since rotation is done in a clockwise direction       In the figure below, rectangle is the image of rectangle under a rotation, centre      (a). By construction,find and label the centre of roration.  (b) Determine the angle of rotation.        Rotation on Different Planes   Rotation on different planes\" refers to the concept of rotating an object or point around various axes within different planes in a three-dimensional space.    Rotation in the Cartesian Plane     Work in pairs      Draw a large axis (horizontal) and axis (Vertical) on a graph of paper. Mark the origin where the two axis meet.      Pick any point and plot this point on the plane and label it for example let;s use .      Rotate the point in a counterclockwise direction around the origin with different angles as shown below:                             Similary rotate the point in a clockwise direction around the origin with different angles as shown below:                                   The image of point remains the same when rotated through (clockwise or counterclockwise) about the origin.    A rotation through and about the origin does not change the position of the object.     In summary, a point which is rotated through the indicated angles about the origin is shown in the table below.                             The figure below shows triangle and its images after rotations about the origin with different angles of rotation ( , , and ).                                                                                              Consider a point .We are required to finding the coordinates of its image after a Rotation taking the centre to be and angle of rotation to be ;   is mapped onto .  Given the point and the centre of rotation , To obtain this point without a graph, We follow this steps;     from the given points, for point ,We let and and for the given centre we let and .     Considering the same point , but now the angle of rotation to be ; To find the coordinates of its image we follow the following steps:  Given the point and the centre of rotation , To find the point of the image we follow the following steps;            A triangle with coordinates , and is rotated through the centre and angle of in a clockwise direction.Find the coordinates of its image    Since triangle is rotated in a clockwise direction with an angle of through the origin, then the angle of rotation is   According to the rule, If we have our points which will be mapped to if rotated through the centre and angle of rotation is   Therefore, we will individually apply the rotation formula to all three given points.     The coordinates of triangle are , and       A point maps onto under a rotation R centre . Find the angle of rotation.    Describe the rotation which maps the rectangle whose verticies are , , and onto a rectangle whose verticies are , , and     Give the coordinates of the image of each of the following points when rotated through in a clockwise direction about    (a) (4,-2)  (b) (-2,2)  (c) (4,4)  (d) (-2,-1)  (e) (-3,2)      Find the coordinates of the verticies of the image of a triangle whose verticies are , and when rotated about the origin through:   (a)   (b)   (c)        The parallelogram whose verticies are , , and is rotated to give an image whose verticies are , , and . Find the centre and angle of rotation.        Rotational Symmetry    Determining the Order of Rotational Symmetry of Plane Figures    Work in groups    Materials      A printed copy of the figure.    Pencils, push pin.    Constuction paper.    Pair of scissors.         Instructions      On a construction paper, trace and cut the figure above.    Place the tracing on top the printed copy and place a pin through their centre such that the tracing can rotate.    Manually rotate the tracing around the centre and note how many times the shape looks exactly the same in one full turn       Key Takeaway   The number of times the tracing of the star fits onto the printed copy in one complete turn is times. This is called the order of rotational symmetry, that is, the number of times the figure fits onto itself in one complete turn   When given a figure with the measure of the angle between the identical parts, the order of rotational symmetry can be computed as shown.        Find the order of rotational symmetry in the figure below.                     State the order of symmetry in the figures below.                            Find the order of rotational symmetry in the letters of the alphabet.       Determining the Axis of Rotation and Order of Rotational Symmetry in Solids    Here is an activity to explore on axis of rotation of a box (cuboid).   Materials      A cuboid shaped box    Three strings    Pins, ruler and pencil      Instructions      Measure and note down the cuboid’s dimensions (length, width, height).    Mark the centre of box on each face using a pencil and make holes using pins through the centres.    Put the strings through the holes such that they appear as shown.    Suspend the cuboid and spin it around each of the strings and observe the alignment of the cuboid. Does the box appear to be the same as you rotate?           Key Takeaway      A solid has rotational symmetry if it can be rotated about a fixed straight line and still appears to be the same.    The straight line around which the object is rotated is called axis of rotation. In the activity, the strings represents the axes of rotational symmetry for the cuboid.       Find the axes of rotation for a triangular pyramid whose cross-section is an equilateral triangle.    The figure below shows a triangular prism whose cross-section is an equialteral triangle.  The axis of rotation passes through the traingular face. Therefore, the order of rotation through this axis is      The prism also has other axes of rotation with each axis having orders of rotational symmetry as shown in the figure below:         Find the axis of rotation of a cone. What is the order of rotational symmetry?    A cone has one axis of rotation with infinite numbers of order of rotational symmetry since its base is circular.          Find the other axes of rotation and order of rotational symmetry of the regular tetrehedron given one of the axes from and passing at the center of the face .         Find the axes of rotation and order of rotational symmetry of a triangular base pyramid whose base is:     Scalene triangle    Isosceles triangle           Rotation and Congruence     Work in groups   Copy the trangle and the point on a graph paper. Using a ruler and a protractor, rotate the triangle about point   Draw a dotted line to connect vertex to point      Place a protractor at the line with the centre of the protractor at and measure Using a ruler draw such that      Repeat the step above for for vertices         Key Takeaway   Congruence refers to a relationship between two figures or objects, whereby, they are identical in size and shape.  Rotation is a type of transformation that repositions an object but preserves the shape and size of the object. Thus, rotation produces congruent figures.   and are similar in size and shape. Therefore, they are said to be directly congruent.    Triangle is mapped onto after a rotation of and centre of rotation          have the same shape and size.    The length of the corresponding sides of are the same.    Every corresponding internal angle for the triangles remain the same.     Therefore, are said to be directly congruent.        Identify the axes of rotational symmetry and their respective order in the following:     Cylinder    Rectangular pyramid    Sphere    Cube         Identify the axes of rotational symmetry and their respective order for the following figures:              "

  "title": "Trigonometry 1",
  "body": " Trigonometry 1   By the end of this topic, you should be able to:     Define and apply trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent).    Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find missing sides in right-angled triangles.    Solve for unknown sides and angles using trigonometric ratios.    Apply trigonometric values of special angles ( ) in solving geometric problems.    Analyze and interpret relationships between angles and side lengths in various contexts to solve application problems.        Trigonometric Ratios of Acute Angles    Tangent of an Acute Angle       What you require:      A piece of paper    A ruler    A pencil        Using a piece of paper, a ruler, and a pencil, carefully draw the diagram shown below.   fig 1.2       Measure and record the lengths of using a ruler..   Identify whether triangles are similar.  If they are similar, compare the ratios of their corresponding sides.    Calculate the following ratios:             Observe the ratios from the previous step.  What do you notice about the relationship between them?    Considering the parallel lines , and examine the relationship between the vertical and horizontal distances.  What do you notice about their ratios?   Use a protractor to measure the angle marked in the diagram.   Share your observations and conclusions with your classmates.            The inclination of the observer's line of sight to the top of a high flag pole, positioned away, can be determined using a scale drawing, as illustrated in the diagram below.        What do we call the angle represented by ?    Look at the triangle shown in   Express in terms of the lengths of the sides of the triangle.   Hint: Recall that in a right-angled triangle:         When given the triangle below, you will notice the following:           The triangles are similar.  This means that the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal:     For any line parallel to , rthe ratio of vertical distance to horizontal distance remains the same in each triangle. In this case, the ratio is .  This constant ratio, is called the .  Therefore, the tangent of is which can be written as:   The tangent of an angle depends only on the size of the angle, not on the triangle's size.     The diagram below shows a right-angled triangle , where: .           The side is the vertical side, which is to angle .    The side is the horizontal side, which is to angle     The side is the , which is the longest side of the right-angled triangle.     In this case, the tangent of angle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side: .    Find the tangent of the indicated angles using the given measurements below.       The above diagram the sides given are,  Opposite side   Adjacent side   Therefore,     Therefore,       Find the tangent in the indicated angle below.       The first thing you should do is to calculate the perpendicular height of the Triangle then identify the opposite and the adjacent sides of angle and angle . Finaly find there tangents.  Finding the perpendicular height.  We use pythagorean relationship that is      Finding      The opposite side   The adjacent side      Finding      The opposite side   The adjacent side      Therefore,               What you require: Printed Table of Tangent, a ruler, pencil, and calculator (for verification).     What is the tangent of an angle?    How do we use a Table of Tangents?    Use your Table of Tangent to find the folowing tangents.                            Discuss your findings with other groups in your class.         Special tables have been prepared and can be used to obtain tangents of acute angle (see tables of natural tangents in your mathematical tables). The technique of reading tables of tangents is similar to that of reading tables of logarithms or square roots.  Here's how you can use it:     Identify the angle     Find the given angle in the leftmost column (if degrees) or the top row (if radians).       Locate the Tangent Value     Read across the row (or down the column) to find the corresponding tangent value.         Note      In the tables of tangents, the angles are expressed in decimals and degrees or in degrees and minutes.    One degree is equal to . Thus, .     From the table, the values of tangents increase as the angles approach     Find the tangent of each of the following angles from the table:                               Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Convert to degrees by deviding by      Therefore,   Using decimal tables, . From the difference column under reads   Therefore,          Using natural tangents in your mathematical tables, find as shown in the figure below.       Opposite   Adjacent      Note that cannot be read directly from the tables of tangents. Therefore, look for a number nearest to from the tables. In this case, the nearest number is The angle whose tangent is is   The difference between and is . From the difference column in the tangent tables, the nearest number to is which gives a difference of .  Adding to we get .  Therefore, the angle whose tangent is    Thus, .

Create a net for their object (either by unfolding a model or using printed templates).    Trace the faces onto grid paper or measure them using a ruler or string.    Calculate the area of each face using appropriate formulas.    Add up all face areas to find the total surface area.    For cylinders and cones, use a string to measure the curved part.          Wrap or cover real items (e.g., a cereal box, soda can) using calculated surface area. Design a custom box or can with a specific surface area for packaging a product.      How did your net help you find the surface area?    What would happen if your object was twice as big — would surface area double?   Derive and apply surface area formulas using practical reasoning and measurement.      Surface area is the total area of the exposed or outer surfaces of a prism.  🔹A right prism is a geometric solid that has a polygon as its base and vertical faces perpendicular to the base. The base and top surface are the same shape and size. It is called a “right” prism because the angles between the base and faces are right angles.  🔹 The name given to the solid that is unfolded this way is called a net. When a prism is unfolded into a net, we can clearly see each of its faces.  🔹 We can thereby clearly calculate the surface area by finding the area of each faces and add them all together to get the surface area of the Prism.  🔹 For example, If we are given a cylinder, the top and bottom faces are circles and the curved area is like a rectangle. So when finding it's surface area we find the area of the two circles and the area of the rectangle then we add all these areas all together to compute the cylinder's surface area.

Volume of a Sphere           Materials Needed:  ♦ An orange (or any round fruit)  ♦ A knife  ♦ A flat surface            Cut the orange in half and carefully peel the skin off in small sections.    Try flattening the peels and arrange them to see how they approximate a circle’s area.  ♦ When you peel an orange and flatten the pieces, you can see that the peels cover a large area.  ♦ This helps visualize why increasing the radius increases the overall amount of space the fruit takes up (its volume).    Cutting the Orange into Sections.  ♦ If you cut an orange in half, you can see its cross-section.  ♦ If you keep slicing it into smaller spheres, their individual radii determine their volumes.    Why do you think oranges or tomatoes or apples etc. are stacking in pyramidal stacks in the market?  ♦ Oranges in a fruit market are often packed in pyramidal stacks because spheres fit together efficiently.  ♦ The larger the radius, the more space each orange occupies, which directly affects storage and packaging.

  "body": " Vectors I   In mathematics, vectors are a fundamental concept that goes beyond numbers. Suppose I ask, \"How far is your home from school?\" One possible response is \" kilometers.\" However, I can't get to your home with just this information. I would also need to know the direction, whether it is east, west, northeast, or south. This combination of both distance and direction is what a vector represents.    Pilots use vectors to calculate the distance and direction they need to take inorder to travel from one location to another. In this section, we will explore how to use vectors and apply different operations on them.

This is a velocity-time graph that shows Acceleration, Constant Speed, and Deceleration.         A car starts from rest and accelerates to a velocity of in . It then maintains this velocity for before decelerating to rest, with the total time of motion being      Draw the velocity-time graph to represent its motion.    Find the total distance covered.

Distance during constant velocity (rectangle)       Distance during deceleration (triangle)       Total distance:   =   Therefore, the total distance is        Average Velocity     Therefore, the average velocity is     Acceleration and Deceleration  Using the equation:     Where;   = is the final velocity ( , from the graph)   = is the initial velocity ( )   = is the time taken during acceleration ( ).     Therefore, acceleration is   Under deceleration;   is the final velocity ( , since the car comes to rest),   is the initial velocity ( , from the graph)   is the time taken during deceleration ( ).     Therefore, the object is decelerating at           Given the table below      Time            Velocity (m\/s)                Draw the velocity time graph to represent the data    Use the graph to describe the motion of the vehicle. Is the velocity constant, increasing, or decreasing? Explain your answer.

It then continues at this speed for before decelerating uniformly to rest over . The total time of motion is      Draw the velocity-time graph to represent its motion.    Find the total distance covered.    Determine the average velocity.    Calculate the acceleration and deceleration.         After takeoff, an airplane reaches a cruising speed of and maintains it for . Draw a velocity-time graph representing the motion of the airplane from = to = .      A cyclist starts at and increases speed to in .     Draw the Velocity-Time Graph.    Calculate the acceleration of the cyclist.    What type of motion is represented by the velocity-time graph you drew?           Relative Speed    Relative speed is a simple concept that helps us understand how fast one object is moving compared to another object. It's important because sometimes objects are moving at different speeds, and we need to figure out how quickly they are closing the gap between them or moving away from each other.  Consider a case where two bodies moving in the same direction at different speeds. Their is the difference between the individual speeds.  But if they are moving toward each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.    When Objects Move in the Same Direction    Work in Groups.   In this activity you are required to follow each step as listed.   Requirements:    Toy car (that can be pulled by a string).    String (long enough for the car to travel a sufficient distance).    Stopwatch or timer    Measuring tape or marked distance on the ground (e.g., 10 meters)    Pen and paper (for recording results)    Observers (to track the race and help evaluate results)    Calculator (optional, for calculations)    Steps:    Find a straight line or pathway that is clear and suitable for the race ( a hallway, classroom floor, long corridor or outside on a field).    Measure out a distance for the race, such as 10 meters. You can use a measuring tape or use a marked area to set the starting and finishing points.    Mark the starting line and the finish line clearly, so both the toy car and the student know where to start and end.    Attach one end of the string securely to the toy car. The other end of the string should be held by a participant or fixed to an anchor (like a pole or sturdy object) so that when the student pulls the string, the car moves along the line and test the toy car to ensure that it moves easily along the straight path when the string is pulled.    You will have two participants: one student (who will walk) and one toy car (which will be pulled by the string).    Assign at least one observer to track the race. The observer(s) will help measure the time it takes for each participant (the student and the toy car) to reach the finish line.    Place the student and the toy at the starting line. The student should be ready to walk at a constant speed.    On the count of \"Go!\", the student starts walking in a straight line towards the finish line. At the same time, the person holding the string should start pulling the toy car in the same direction (straight line) at a constant speed. The toy car should be pulled in a way that resembles a consistent movement, not too fast or too slow.    The observers should start the stopwatch as soon as both participants begin moving and stop it when either the student or the toy car reaches the finish line.    Record the time taken by both the student and the toy car to reach the finish line. If you have more than one observer, make sure they agree on the recorded times.    After the race, you need to calculate the relative speed between the student and the toy car.   Let's say the student took seconds to cover the distance ( meters), and the toy took seconds to cover same distance    The speed of the student is: The speed of the toy car is:     If the student and the toy car are moving in the same direction, the relative speed can be given as:        Compare and share your fndings with other groups of both the student and the toy car.    Discuss;   Who moved faster? Was the student walking faster or slower than the toy car?    Why one object might have moved faster than the other. Did the toy car move faster because it was pulled, or was the student faster in their walking?    The relative speed: How does the speed of each participant relate to the other? Did they move away from each other, or did they move closer together?       Now try the activity in different conditions or compare vraious speed by repeating the race multiple times.   Have the student walk faster or slower.    Change the length of the race to see how it affects the results.    Adjust how fast the toy car is pulled.             A cyclist is riding at a speed of  km\/h , and a motorcycle is moving at a speed of  km\/h on the same road in the same direction. If the cyclist starts meters ahead of the motorcycle, how long will it take for the motorcycle to overtake the cyclist?    Since the objects are moving in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed by subtracting the cyclist's speed from the motorcycle's speed:         Now let's convert relative speed to meters per second, so that we can work with the distance in meters, we need to convert the relative speed from km\/h to m\/s.     The initial distance between the motorcycle and the cyclist is 100 meters. To calculate the time it will take for the motorcycle to overtake the cyclist,we have:             A car travels at  km\/h , and a truck travels at  km\/h in the same direction on a straight road. If the car starts meters behind the truck, how long will it take for the car to overtake the truck    The relative speed between the car and the truck is:         Convert Relative Speed to Meters per Second: Convert 15 km\/h to m\/s:    The initial distance between the car and the truck is 150 meters. Use the formula to calculate the time:              A cyclist is riding at a speed of  km\/h , and a motorcycle is traveling at  km\/h on the same road. If the cyclist starts meters ahead of the motorcycle, how long will it take for the motorcycle to overtake the cyclist?      A toy car is being pulled along a straight path at a speed of  m\/s , while a person walks at  m\/s along the same path. If the toy car starts meters ahead of the person, how much time will it take for the person to catch up with the toy car?      Two cyclists are riding along the same road. Cyclist is traveling at  km\/h and Cyclist is traveling at  km\/h . If Cyclist starts meters behind Cyclist , how long will it take for Cyclist to overtake Cyclist ?      A person walks at a speed of  m\/s , and a dog runs at a speed of  m\/s . If the dog starts meters behind the person, how long will it take the dog to catch up with the person?      Two buses are traveling on the same road in the same direction. Bus moves at  km\/h , and Bus moves at  km\/h . If Bus is meters behind Bus , how long will it take for Bus to overtake Bus B?       When Objects Move Toward Each Other (Opposite Directions).   Using Activity 2.9.7. above now try the race such t he racers move towards each other such that.   Using the starting and finishing point.   Put the Student on the marked end, and    The Toy car on the other end.       Measure time, record and calculate the speeds.    If the student and the toy car are moving in the same direction, the reative speed is given as;     Discuss;   Who moved faster? Was the student walking faster or slower than the toy car?    Why one object might have moved faster than the other. Did the toy car move faster because it was pulled, or was the student faster in their walking?    The relative speed: How does the speed of each participant relate to the other? Did they move away from each other, or did they move closer together?       Now try the activity in different conditions or compare vraious speed by repeating the race multiple times.   Have the student walk faster or slower.    Change the length of the race to see how it affects the results.    Adjust how fast the toy car is pulled.           A train left town X at  AM and traveled towards town at a speed of  km\/h . A second train left town at  AM and traveled towards town at  km\/h . The distance between town and town is  .   At what time will the two trains meet?    How far from town X will they meet?       The first train departs at  AM , and the second train departs at  AM . Therefore, the first train travels for hour before the second train starts.  The distance traveled by the first train in 1 hour:    Thus, by  AM , the remaining distance between the two trains is: The time it takes for the two trains to meet after 11:00 AM is given by the formula:       This is approximately 1 hr and 17 minutes.   Therefore, the trains will meet at: So the two trains meet at   The distance traveled by the first train before the meeting is:    Thus, the meeting point is approximately from town       Two cyclists start from the same point and travel in opposite directions. One cyclist rides at 20 km\/h, and the other rides at 30 km\/h. After 2 hours, they are 100 km apart.   How long did it take for the cyclists to be 100 km apart?    How far did each cyclist travel?       The cyclists are moving in opposite directions. The total distance between them after hours is  km .  Since the cyclists are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds: In 2 hours, the total distance traveled by both cyclists is:    So, the cyclists will be 100 km apart after 2 hours. This confirms the given information.  The first cyclist, riding at 20 km\/h, travels:    The second cyclist, riding at 30 km\/h, travels:        A motorist left Nakuru for Nairobi, a distance of km, at 8.00 am. and travelled at an average speed of km\/h. Another motorist left Nairobi for Nakuru at  am . and travelled at  km\/h . Find:   The time they met.    How far from Nairobi they met.         A train travels from Mombasa to Nairobi, a distance of  km , at a speed of  km\/h .

A matatu left town at  am and travelled towards a town at an average speed of  km\/h . A second matatu left town at  am and travelled towards town at  km\/h . If the distance between the two towns is  km , find:   The time at which the two matatus met.    The distance of the meeting point from town .         A cyclist is riding towards a motorcyclist on a straight road. The cyclist travels at  km\/h and the motorcyclist at  km\/h . If they are initially meters apart, how long will it take for the motorcyclist to overtake the cyclist?      Two cars, and , are traveling on parallel roads. Car moves at a speed of  km\/h and car moves at  km\/h . If car is meters behind car , how long will it take for car to overtake car ?       "

  "body": "  Work in Groups.   In this activity you are required to follow each step as listed.   Requirements:    Toy car (that can be pulled by a string).    String (long enough for the car to travel a sufficient distance).    Stopwatch or timer    Measuring tape or marked distance on the ground (e.g., 10 meters)    Pen and paper (for recording results)    Observers (to track the race and help evaluate results)    Calculator (optional, for calculations)    Steps:    Find a straight line or pathway that is clear and suitable for the race ( a hallway, classroom floor, long corridor or outside on a field).    Measure out a distance for the race, such as 10 meters. You can use a measuring tape or use a marked area to set the starting and finishing points.    Mark the starting line and the finish line clearly, so both the toy car and the student know where to start and end.    Attach one end of the string securely to the toy car. The other end of the string should be held by a participant or fixed to an anchor (like a pole or sturdy object) so that when the student pulls the string, the car moves along the line and test the toy car to ensure that it moves easily along the straight path when the string is pulled.    You will have two participants: one student (who will walk) and one toy car (which will be pulled by the string).    Assign at least one observer to track the race. The observer(s) will help measure the time it takes for each participant (the student and the toy car) to reach the finish line.    Place the student and the toy at the starting line. The student should be ready to walk at a constant speed.    On the count of \"Go!\", the student starts walking in a straight line towards the finish line. At the same time, the person holding the string should start pulling the toy car in the same direction (straight line) at a constant speed. The toy car should be pulled in a way that resembles a consistent movement, not too fast or too slow.    The observers should start the stopwatch as soon as both participants begin moving and stop it when either the student or the toy car reaches the finish line.    Record the time taken by both the student and the toy car to reach the finish line. If you have more than one observer, make sure they agree on the recorded times.    After the race, you need to calculate the relative speed between the student and the toy car.   Let's say the student took seconds to cover the distance ( meters), and the toy took seconds to cover same distance    The speed of the student is: The speed of the toy car is:     If the student and the toy car are moving in the same direction, the relative speed can be given as:        Compare and share your fndings with other groups of both the student and the toy car.    Discuss;   Who moved faster? Was the student walking faster or slower than the toy car?    Why one object might have moved faster than the other. Did the toy car move faster because it was pulled, or was the student faster in their walking?    The relative speed: How does the speed of each participant relate to the other? Did they move away from each other, or did they move closer together?       Now try the activity in different conditions or compare vraious speed by repeating the race multiple times.   Have the student walk faster or slower.    Change the length of the race to see how it affects the results.    Adjust how fast the toy car is pulled.        "

In our daily lives, we are constantly surrounded by data from school exam results, sports scores, population figures, business sales, weather reports, to health records.  Understanding statistics helps us make sense of this information and use it to solve real life problems.    Collection of Data   Collection of data is the process of gathering information or facts for analysis. In statistics, data can be collected to answer questions, test ideas or solve problems in real-life situations.    Sources of Data      A teacher assigned students a research topic on the effects of social media on teenage mental health in Kenya.     Suggest one potential primary data collection method that could be used.    Suggest one potential secondary data source that could be used.    What is the difference between primary and secondary data?    Why is secondary data important for research and decision-making?    Discuss and share with other groups.         Data can be obtained from primary sources, which are original first-hand data collected directly for a specific purpose (e.g., surveys, interviews),  secondary sources, which are previously collected data used for a different purpose (e.g., government reports, research articles),  and tertiary sources, which summarize and compile information from primary and secondary sources (e.g., dictionaries, textbooks, encyclopedias).    Classify the Following as Primary or Secondary Data Sources:    A student conducts a survey to find out the favorite sports of their classmates.  A teacher uses last year’s national exam results to analyze student performance trends.  A researcher reads a government report on the most common diseases in Kenya.  A doctor observes a patient’s symptoms and records them for a medical study.  A scientist conducts an experiment to test the growth rate of plants under different conditions.        Primary because the student is collecting first-hand data directly from people.  Secondary because the exam results were already collected and recorded by an external body.  Secondary because The report was collected and published by someone else for a different purpose.  Primary because The doctor is directly collecting new data from real-life observation.  Primary because The scientist is generating new data through an experiment.        A community group wants to understand the needs of youth in their area.     What primary data collection methods could the group use?    What problems might they have when trying to find this information?    How can they use the information they find to help the community?    What secondary data sources could be useful to this community group?          Focus groups, surveys, interviews.       Overcoming language barriers.    Getting honest responses.          They can start new programs for young people.    They can tell leaders what young people need.          Academic studies on youth issues.    Government reports on youth.             Grade students from Korinyang Primary School went to Lake Nakuru National Park and counted the flamingos they saw for their Biology project.     Is this a primary or secondary data source?    Give reason.         In a market, a shop owner watches what customers buy most often and looks for trends based on what they see in the store.

Why is it important to keep accurate records when conducting observations?      Give one example of a situation where you would use secondary data collection in a Geography class.        Representing Data using a Frequency Distribution Table         Below are the weekly pocket expenses (in Ksh) of a randomly selected group of students.          Draw a grouped frequency distribution table with classes to represent the data?    Identify the number with the highest frequency.    Compare your answer with others in class.         A frequency distrribution table is a table that shows an event and how many times it happens.  There are two types:      : for small datasets with individual values.     : for large datasets where values are grouped into intervals.        Determine the Range of Data       Decide the Number of Classes (Groups)    Calculate the Class Width       Establish Class Boundaries     Begin with the Lowest Value: Use the smallest data value as the lower limit of the first class.    Determine the Upper Limit: Add the class width to establish the upper limit of the first class and the lower limit of the next class.    Repeat the Process: Continue this pattern until all class intervals are created.       Tally the Frequencies     Count how many data points fall within each class interval and record the frequency.       Complete the Table     Class Interval    Tally Marks    Frequency(f)             The following data represents test scores of students in a grade class.

The costs (in Ksh.) of manufacturing equipment across different factories were recorded as follows:              Prepare a frequency distribution table for the grouped data.      The annual rainfall (in mm) recorded in a region was as follows:        Construct a grouped frequency distribution table for the data.        Measures of Central Tendency   Measures of central tendency are statistical values that describe the center or average of a set of data.  They help us identify a single number that represents the entire distribution of data, giving us an idea of what is “typical” or “common.”  The three main measures are Mean, Median and Mode.  Together, these measures give us different perspectives of the center of the data.    Ungrouped Data for Measures of Central Tendency  Ungrouped data is the raw form of data, where individual observations are listed as they are collected, without being organized into groups or classes  It is simply a list of numbers, facts, or values recorded in the order they are obtained         Consider the following data set:        Construct a frequency distribution table for the data.    Find the Mean, Mode and Median for the data.    Discuss with other groups         There are three main measures of central tendency:        Mean is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values. It is also known as Arithmetic Average.     Where represents the values in the dataset and is the total number of values.  Frequency distribution table can be used to find the mean for the ungrouped data. Using the formula below:     Where;      represents the values in the dataset     is the mean     is the sum of products of and      is the Sum of frequencies          Median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.  To find the median for even numbers, the formula is;   =        Mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. A dataset can have:    No mode: if no value repeats.  One mode (Unimodal): if one value appears most frequently.  Two modes (Bimodal): if two values appear equally most frequently.  Multimodal: if more than two values appear frequently.         In a class of students, the test scores of students are:      Find the:     Mean    Median    Mode          The formula for the mean is:     Where;      is the sum of all values     is the total number of values      =         =      Therefore, the mean is     Median  The median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.        Since there are values (even number), the median is;   =   =    =    =      Therefore the median is     Mode  The mode is the most frequently occurring values.  From the sorted data:      appears times     appears times     Since and appear most frequently, this dataset is bimodal with modes: and .         The frequency distribution table below shows marks of students in a Grade 10 class.      Marks (x)  Frequency (f)  fx                                                Find the mean    find the mode          To find the mean     Therefore, the mean is     The mode is the mark with the highest frequency. In this case, the highest frequency is , which corresponds to .  Therefore, Mode is           The number of books borrowed by students from a school library in a week is as follows:        Find the Mean (Average) number of books borrowed.    Find the Median number of books borrowed.    Find the Mode of the books borrowed.         The following frequency distribution table represents volume of water (in liters) contained in different bottles:      Volume of water (liters)  Number of bottles                            Find the mean volume of water in the bottles.    Determine the mode of the data.    Find the median volume.         A company records the monthly salaries (in KES) of its employees.      Salary (KES)  Frequency                         Calculate the mean, median and mode.      A factory records the number of products manufactured in a week:              Make a frequency distribution table for the set of data.    Calculate the mean, mode and median.          Grouped Data for Measures of Central Tendency  Grouped data is data that has been organized into classes or intervals together with their frequencies.  Instead of listing every single value (as in ungrouped data), the observations are arranged into groups (class intervals) to make large data sets easier to understand, analyze, and interpret.      The amount of pocket money, in shillings, that parents give to students per week.      Pocket Money (Ksh)         Number of students             What is the modal class of pocket money given to students?    Calculate the mean of pocket money given to students per week.    Find the median amount of pocket money from the given data.    Discuss with other groups.               Frequency distribution table can be used to find the mean for the grouped data. Using the formula below:     Where;      is the midpoint     is the mean     is the sum of products of and      is the Sum of frequencies      is the average of the lower and upper boundaries of a class interval. It represents the central value of each class.          For grouped frequency data, we use interpolation to estimate the median using the following formula;     Where;      = Lower boundary of the median class.     = sum of all frequencies.     = Cumulative frequency before the median class.     = Frequency of the median class.     = class width          The Modal class is the class with highest frequency.       A company records the monthly salaries (in KES) of employees in a frequency distribution table below:      Salary Range(KES)  Number of Employees                                            Find the mean and mode of the data.    Find the modal class of the data.          To calculate the mean of the grouped data we need to find;      which is the sum of products of and      is the sum of frequencies         Salary Range(KES)  Midpoint(x)  Number of Employees(f)  xf                                                                    Therefore, the mean is     The modal class is , since is the one with the highest frequency.         The data below represents the times (in seconds) recorded in the heats of a race during an athletics event:              Create a frequency distribution table using class intervals:                 Determine the modal class    Estimate median based on the frequency table.    Find the mean based on the frequency table.          To create a frequency distribution table We need to count how many values fall into each class interval.      Class Interval (seconds)  Midpoint(x)  Frequency(f)  Cumulative frequency(CF)  fx                                                                             The modal class is the class interval with the highest frequency.  From the table, The highest frequency is , which appears in class interval: .  So, the modal class is     Total frequency (∑f) =   Median position is =   The cumulative frequency just before is , and the next class reaches , so the median class is .  Using the median formula:     Where;     L = (lower boundary of median class)     =     CF = (cumulative frequency before the median class)    F = (frequency of the median class)    C = class width        Thus, the median time is .    The mean is given by;     From the table;   =    =      Thus, the mean time is           Mathematics test scores for students in a class from Ichina primary school are:                 Create a frequency distribution table using class intervals of , starting from , , , ..., .

Calculate the Mean rainfall.    Determine the Median rainfall.            Representation of Data   Representation of data is the process of presenting collected information (data) in an organized and visual form so that it is easy to understand, interpret and analyze.  Instead of leaving data as raw numbers, we use tables, charts and graphs to show patterns, trends, and comparisons more clearly.    Drawing Histograms and Frequency Polygons of Data   Work in groups  In a school with students, their heights were measured and recorded in the following table.      Height (cm)  Number of Students (Frequency)                                Choose a suitable scale and represent the data on a histogram and a frequency polygon.    Compare and discuss your graphs with other groups.         A histogram uses adjacent bars to show frequency distribution, while a frequency polygon connects the midpoints of the bars with a line to show patterns.   is the difference between the upper and lower boundaries of a class.   means all bars have the same width.   means bars have different widths to better represent uneven data.   is a measure used in histograms to ensure that the area of each bar represents the actual frequency of observations, especially when class widths are unequal.  Frequency density is calculated using the formula:     Where;   is the number of observations in a class interval.        In a histogram, the area of each bar (not just the height) represents the frequency.    If class widths are unequal, simply plotting frequency would distort the representation.    Using frequency density ensures that the area of each bar remains proportional to the actual frequency.      of a class interval represents the central value of that range. It is the average of the lower and upper boundaries of the class.  Formula for midpoint:       The table below presents the salary distribution of employees in a company.      Salary Range (KSh)  Frequency                             Draw a histogram and a frequency polygon to represent the data.    To draw a histogram and a frequency polygon, we need to find the frequency density and the midpoint of each class interval.  We use frequency density instead of frequency to draw the histogram because the class widths are unequal.  The formula for frequency density:     The formula for Midpoint:         Salary range(Ksh.)  Frequency  Class width  Frequency density  Midpoint                                                      The following frequency distribution shows the daily rainfall amounts (in mm) recorded at a weather station over a day period.      Rainfall(mm)  Frequency                         Create a histogram to represent this data.    To draw a histogram we need to find the frequency density because class width are unequal.  The formula for frequency density:         Rainfall(mm)  Frequency  Class width  Frequency density                                           The following data represents the heights (in cm) of students in a class:           Create a frequency table with class intervals of and midpoints of the data.    Using the frequency table you created Draw a histogram to represent the data.    Draw a frequency polygon on the same axes as your histogram.    Label your axes and give your graphs appropriate titles.

The following frequency table shows the results:      Number of Books Read  Frequency                            Draw a histogram to represent the data from your frequency table.    On the same axes, draw a frequency polygon.    Estimate the median number of books read. Explain your reasoning.         A survey was conducted to find out how much time people spend on social media daily. The following data was collected:      Time (Minutes)  Frequency  Class Width  Frequency Density                                      Draw a histogram to represent the sales data.    Draw a frequency polygon to represent the sales data.    Label your axes and provide appropriate titles for your graphs.           Interpretation of data   Interpretation of data is the process of examining and explaining the meaning of organized or represented data in order to draw conclusions, make decisions or solve problems.  Once data is collected and represented in tables, graphs or charts, we look for patterns, relationships and trends to understand what the data is telling us.    Interpreting Histograms and Frequency Polygons of Data      The histogram below represent a household's daily water consumption (in liters) recorded over a month.        Determine the day when the water consumption was high.    Determine the day when the water consumption was low.    Discuss and share with other group.            Interpretation of data helps us understand collected information by finding patterns, trends, and connections so we can make better decisions.       The histogram below represents the ages of attendees recorded by the organizers at a community event.        How many age groups are represented in the histogram?    What is the total number of attendees recorded in the histogram?    Which age group has the highest number of attendees?          By counting the number of bars in the histogram, we can determine the number of age groups.  The bars are   Therefore, there were five age groups that attended the event.    The total number of attendees is the sum of all frequencies (heights of the bars).   =   Therefore, the number of attendees were     The age group corresponding to the tallest bar has the highest number of attendees.  Therefore, the age group had the highest number of attendees, with a total of participants.

It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where:    means the event is impossible.     means the event is certain.    A probability closer to indicates a higher likelihood of the event occurring.     Probability is always between 0 and 1               - A process that leads to a specific result.     - A possible result of an experiment.     - A collection of one or more outcomes.     - The set of all possible outcomes.     - A measure of how likely an event is to occur.     Probability is widely used in everyday life, including:      - Meteorologists predict the likelihood of rain based on past data.     - Coaches analyze the probability of winning based on past performance.     - Doctors assess the probability of a patient responding to treatment.     - Insurance companies use probability to determine policy pricing.     - Dice rolling and card games use probability.       Probability Experiment and Sample Space      Here the material needed is only 1 coin  Toss a coin 20 times and record how many times it lands on heads and tails.  Discuss     Give the sample space    Compare your sample spaces         A probability experiment is an action or a process that results in a set of possible outcomes. The collection of all possible outcomes is called the sample space.    A student of Makhokho Secondary School rolled a six-sided die.

Compare and discuss answers with other groups         Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.  This means that if one event happens, the other cannot.  If and are mutually exclusive events, then;      The probability of either or occurring is;       A traffic light being red and the same traffic light being green at the exact same time.    You are sleeping and you are wide awake at the exact same moment.    A door being open and the same door being closed at the same time.       Roll a fair six-sided die, what is the probability of rolling either a or a ?    Sample Space   Favorable Outcomes              Since rolling a 3 and rolling a 5 are mutually exclusive events;     the probability of rolling a or is or       A card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Let Event A be drawing a Heart and Event B be drawing a Spade. Are these events mutually exclusive? Explain     Find     Calculate     What is        Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time. Since a card cannot be both a Heart and a Spade, the events are mutually exclusive.     We calculate the probability of drawing a Heart or a Spade.  Since there are in the deck,     Since there are in the deck,       For mutually exclusive events, we use,                Since these events are mutually exclusive, their intersection is zero:             A student at Khungu Senior Secondary School tosses a coin once.

Independent Events         Define Independent events    State one example of two events that are independent    A student can choose to join either the Science Club or the Drama Club, but not both.   If the probability of joining Science Club is and Drama Club is , what is the probability that a student joins either club?    Are these events mutually exclusive or independent? Explain.       Compare and discuss answers with other groups         Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other occurring.  If and are independent events, then;   For events and      This means the probability of both events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities.
