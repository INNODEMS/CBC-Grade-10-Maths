  "body": " Real Numbers   Real numbers represented as are a set of numbers that include all rational and irrational numbers. They can be positive, negative, or zero, and can be represented on the number line. The table below shows classification of real numbers with examples.    Category  Examples    Whole numbers\\, ( )      Integers\\,( )     Fractions     Decimals     Irrational numbers          Real numbers do not include complex numbers like the square root of negative one ( ).     We apply real numbers in our daily lives to manage money while budgeting or shopping for items, to measure ingredients when cooking, to track time and distance while traveling, and to understand data on digital devices.    Classifying whole numbers as odd, even, prime and composite in different situations  Whole numbers can be classified as odd, even, prime or composite based on their divisibility and factor properties.      are numbers that are divisible by .  To identify if a number is even, look at the digits in the ones place value if it or .   are numbers that when divided by two, you get a remainder.  To identify if a number is odd, look at the digit in the ones place value if it is or .        The sum or difference of two even numbers is even.  Example: and .    The sum or difference of two odd numbers is even.  Example: and     The sum of an even and an odd number is odd.  Example:     When two odd integers are multiplied, the result is always an odd number.  Example:     When two odd integers are divided, the result is always an odd number.  Example:     When two even integers are multiplied, the result is an even number.  Example:      An even number multiplied by an odd number equals an even number.  Example:        Classify the following numbers as even or odd:                                          is an odd number since its last digit is .     is an even number since its last digit is .     is an odd number since its last digit is .     is an even number since its last digit is .    For , we first solve for the expression.   therefore, which is even.   is even since multiplication of even numbers results to an even number.    Dividing by we get .  Since the result is then the number is an odd number.         Kirui has cows in his farm and wants to group them equally into pens. Will each pen have an equal number of cows? Explain using even and odd number properties.    First we identify if is even or odd.  Since the last digit is , then is an odd number.  An odd number cannot be divided evenly into equal groups.  Therefore, one group will have cows and the other cows, making it impossible to have equal number of cows in each pen.          Classify the following numbers as even or odd.                                                List all the numbers between and and identify odd and even number from the range.

Classifying real numbers as rational and irrational in different situations    A rational number is any number that can be written as a fraction where and are integers and .  Example:     An irrational number is any number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two intergers.  Example:     consists of positive whole numbers, negative whole numbers and .   The decimal representation of a rational number either terminates (stops at some point) or repeats (continues forever but has a repeating pattern).  Example:    The decimal representation of an irrational number neither terminates (does not stop at any point) nor repeats (continues without following any pattern).  Example:    The square root of a perfect square is a rational number.  Example: and can be written as         Check if the number is an integer or a fraction with an integer as the numerator and the denominator. If it is, then it is a rational number.    If the number is in decimal form, check if the decimal stops at some point. If it stops then the number is a rational number.    If the number is in decimal form, check if the decimal continues. If it continues with a repeated pattern then the number is a rational number and if it continues without a pattern then it is irrational.    If the number is expressed as a square root i.e , find the square root of the number first and identify if it is a perfect or an imperfect square. If it is a perfect square (results to a whole number) then it is rational and if it is an imperfect square, then it is irrational.            Working in groups, write any numbers between and (e.g., )    Form at least fractions using the numbers you formed above. Form both proper and improper fractions e.g., .

Identify if the following numbers are rational or irrational.                                    Since is defined as .  We check if the decimal continues.  Hence is irrational because its decimal continues without having a repeated pattern.    Since is a fraction, we check if the fraction consist of integers with the denominator not equal to zero.  Therefore is a rational number.    To identify if is rational or irrational, we check if the decimal terminates or continues.  Since decimals in terminates, then it is a rational number.    For , first we find its value.      has decimal which continues without a repeated pattern.  Hence is irrational.    The value of    is a fraction with integers on the numerator and the denominator.  Therefore, is rational.         Joy is designing a square garden. She measures the total area of the garden to be square meters and wants to find the length of one side.

  "body": " Indices and Logarithms   Indices   Introduction  Mathematics involves working with very large and very small numbers, which can be simplified using indices. An (plural, ) also called or is a way of writing repeated multiplication of the same number.   Why Are Indices Important?   Indices are widely used in:     Scientific notation writing, where numbers are sometimes very large and sometimes very small, such as the speed of light or the size of an atom.    Physics and Engineering to understand exponential growth and decay rates, such as radioactive decay and population growth.    Finance and money in calculating compound interest.       Expressing Numbers in Index Form  Numbers can be written in different ways. One useful way is index notation also called exponential notation. Index notation, is a way of writing repeated multiplication of the same number.  Exponent is commonly known as the power .    Work in Groups:    Materials Needed: One A4 sheet of paper per student. A piece of paper is approimately. mm thick   Instruction:   Work in groups of students. A piece of paper is approimately. mm thick     Take a piece of paper and fold it in half once. Count the number of layers.    Fold it in half again and count the number of layers.    Continue folding and record your observations in a table.    Express the number of layers using index notation.      Table Showing the Growth of Paper Thickness with Each Fold    Number of Folds  Thickness (mm)  Index Notation    0 (no fold)  0.1 mm     1 fold  0.2 mm     2 folds  0.4 mm     3 folds  ?  ?    4 folds  ?  ?    5 folds  ?  ?      Discussion Questions:      What pattern do you observe in the numbers of layers?    Can you express the pattern using indices?    If you could fold the paper 10 times, how thick would it be?    Can you think of other situations where things double repeatedly?      When writing Index Notation we represent it as:     Where:   is the base (the number being multiplied).   is the (the number of times the base is multiplied by itself).  Therefore given as a whole number;   .......( is the number of times is repeated)   Example:    = ( repeated twice)   = ( repeated thrice)      = ( repeated four times)       Laws of Indices  When we need to work with indices efficiently, we use a set of rules called the Laws of Indices. They are useful in carrying out operations involving indices.   a) Product Law   When multiplying numbers with the same base, add their powers.  i.e    Example:          b) Quotient Law   When dividing numbers with the same base, subtract their powers.  i.e =    Example:             c) Power of a Power Law   When raising a power to another power, multiply the powers.  i.e =    Example:             d) Power of a Product Law   When raising a power to a product factor, multiply the power to all factors inside the bracket.  i.e =    Example:             e) Fractional Powers   A fractional power represents a root.  i.e       Example:   Solve:              Similarly we can say,                                Important      The laws apply only when the bases are the same        Instructions:      Form groups of three    Each group gets a set of index question (on flashcards or written on the board).    Write the question on your notebook    Simplify using the laws of indices that applies to your question.    Each group to present their working to the class.              Simplify the expression:       Expand each power:       Count the total number of factors             Apply the index laws in solving the following expressions:                            Mr. Gitonga is a farmer. He divides his rectangular field into smaller equal plots. The total area of the field is , and each small plot has an area of . How many smaller plots does Mr. Gitonga get? Express your answer using indices.    Mkurugenzi Company investments grows exponentially. It was initially worth Kenyan shillings, but after two years, it was multiplied by . Use indices to represent the total investment value after the two years.    Mathematics department has books that can be borrowed and the science section has books. Write an index expression for the total number of books in both sections if they were combined into a single shelf.    A carpenter is building square tables of different sizes. The first table he makes has an area of square metres. Each new table he builds is twice the length of the previous one.     Express the area of the second and third tables in index form.    Using the Laws of Indices, find the total area of the first three tables combined.    If the carpenter continues doubling the table size, what will be the area of the table?            Negative and Zero Indices  Indices help us simplify repeated multiplication of the same number. But what happens when the exponent is zero or negative?   Zero Indices (Zero Exponent\/Power Zero Law)      Material needed:      Pen and paper    A calculator      Instructions:   Look at the pattern below and complete the missing values:                  Questions:      What pattern do you notice as the exponent decreases by ?    What happens when the exponent reaches zero?    Can you try the same pattern with ?      Conclusion   Any non-zero number raised to power zero is always .  i.e =      Negative Indices     Look at the pattern below and complete the missing values:                       Write the answers as fractions and decimal values.    What do you notice about the negative exponents?    Can you try the same pattern using ?      Conclusion   A negative exponent means taking the reciprocal of the base.  i.e =      Discussion:      What do zero and negative indices represent, and how do they simplify expressions?    How do negative exponents help express very small values and implify small numbers?    Why does any nonzero number raised to power zero equal ? What happens when the base is zero?    Where do we see numbers decreasing exponentially or repeated division in real life?       The school need to make desks for grade students. A carpenter is cutting wooden planks for the desks. The length of each plank decreases by half as he cuts smaller sections.   Plank Lengths and Index Notation    Cut Number  Plank Length (metres)  Index Notation    Original Plank      First Cut  __     Second Cut  __     Third Cut  __       Hint: The negative exponent represents how many times the length has been halved.    Each cut divides the plank by :     The original plank is metre    The first cut halves the plank:       The second cut halves it again:       The third cut follows the same pattern:     If represents the number of cuts, the remaining plank length follows a trend which can bw represented as:     where:   = number of cuts   = remaining length after cuts     Using this formula, let's calculate the length after cuts:     After cuts, the remaining plank length is metres   Key Takeaway   ✔ Negative indices represent repeated division.  ✔ This pattern appears in real-life situations like paper folding, battery energy life, and population decay.

If the population today is 50,000 people, what will it's population be in 30 years time?    Since the population doubles every years, we observe the following:     After years → = people    After years → = people    After years → = people     Instead of calculating step by step, we can use indices.  Since the population doubles every years, we use the exponential growth model:     Where:      = population after years     = Initial population      = number of years years    The base represents doubling every years     Therefore:     Since we simplify:     We now calculate ;     Now,        In years time, the town's population will be people         The Science Club of Bidii Secondary School is conducting an experiment on bacteria growth. They place bacteria in a petri dish and observe that the bacteria triple every hours.     How many bacteria will be present after hours?    How many bacteria will be present after hours?

The school library computer storage was GB in the year , and its capacity doubles every years.     Write an expression using indices for the capacity after years.    What will the storage capacity be after years?       A doctor prescribes a medicine that reduces to of its original amount in the body every hours.     Express the remaining amount after hours in index form.    If the initial dosage was mg, calculate the amount left after hours.       The intensity of sound is measured in decibels and follows an exponential scale. If a normal conversation is times louder than a whisper and a jet engine is times louder than a whisper:     How many times louder is a jet engine compared to a normal conversation?    Express this in index notation.             Logarithms   Why Logarithms?  In the previous section indices allowed us to express large or small numbers using powers. However, sometimes we need to reverse this process. Instead of finding the result of a power, we need to determine the exponent itself, this is where logarithms come in.  A is the inverse of an exponent (index). It tells us the power to which a number must be raised to get another number.  A answers the question:  \"To what power must a given base be raised to produce a certain number?\"   Why Are Logarithms Important?      Logarithms help in solving equations with exponents, especially in finance (compound interest) and Science and Engineering (radioactive decay, sound intensity, etc.)       Logarithms notation     Materials: A Paper\/book and a pen   Instructions:   Pick a number from the set:   Break it down into prime factors using the Tree Factor Method   e.g      Express your final result in index form     Reflection:   Every logarithm is simply another way of writing an exponent.

Quadratics might sound complicated, but they are actually all around us, and learning how to work with them will make solving many kinds of problems much easier. We will start by understanding what quadratic expressions and equations are and how they relate to real-life situations, like calculating areas. You will also learn different ways to solve these equations, such as factorization and completing the square. By the end of this chapter, you'll not only know how to solve quadratic equations but also understand how they apply to everyday problems.  In this chapter the students will be able to:     Define quadratic expressions and equations.    Derive quadratic identities from the concept of area.    Solve quadratic equations by factorization and completing squares.    Derive quadratic formula and use it to solve quadratic equations.    Form quadratic equations different in different situations.    Explore use of quadratic equations in real life situations.         Quadratic Expressions   In this section, we will learn how to form quadratic expressions from different scenarios, simplify them, and use them in various real-life applications. By the end, you should be able to recognize quadratic expressions in different situations and form them based on the given conditions.  A quadratic expression is an expression of the form: where;     and are constatnts (real numbers).     is avariable (what we look for or finding), and     beacuse if , it would not be a quadratic expression.     In the previous grades you learned about algebraic expressions  An expression of the form; is called a monomial expression   A monomial expression is a an expresssion with one term.  A binomial expression is an expression with two terms ie.    Expressions can be formed in various methods;   Multiplying a expresssion with one term ( monmial ) with an expression with two terms ( a binomial )    multiplying two expression with two terms ( two binomials ).       Multiplying a expresssion with one term ( monmial ) with an expression with two terms ( a binomial ).      Simplify:     Opening the brackets      Collecting like terms we form a quadratic expression:     From the example above you can see that;   are the monomial expressions while are the binomial expression.       Simplify the following expressions to form a quadratic expression.     Opening the brackets: Collecting like terms: Simplifying: Thats the required quadratic expression.       Form a quadratic equation using the following terms:                                                                                                                 Multipling Two Expression with Two Terms Two Binomials .  Here we multiply (or expand) two linear biomials         Find the product:      Grouping like terms together:     From the example we can see we formed an algrebaric expressions  The product of two identical binomials is known as the square of the binomial and is written as: If the two terms are of the form (ax + b) and (ax - b) then their product is: This product yields the difference of two squares.      Form a qudratic expression:      Expanding the brackets Collect like terms and form a quadratic expressions:        Form quadratic expression:                                                                                                         Quadratic Identities.     Work Groups   Consider the following equation:    Suppose we have a equation and   In mathematics, an equation is called an identity if the following conditions are satisfied:   Both sides of the equality relation contain some variables.    Both the sides give the same value when the variable is substituted with a particular constant.        If an equation satisfies the two conditions mentioned above, it is known as an identity. There are many mathematical relations that can be classified as identities, but it's not necessary to memorize all of them. However, certain key identities in algebra are essential, as they simplify calculations.    Quadratic identities are special rules or formulas that help us work with quadratic equations .  Common quadratic identities are:   Difference of squares.    Perfect squares.       Difference of Squares.  The Difference of Squares is an identity that applies when you have two terms that are perfect squares and are being subtracted from each other. The identity states: This means that the difference between two squares can be factored into the product of two binomials: one where the terms are subtracted and one where the terms are added.  In the expression , and represent the square roots of the two terms. When you subtract two perfect squares, you can factor the expression as the product of two binomials: and .      Consider the quadratic, solve:     In this case, and The square roots of and are and respectively. Applying the difference of squares identity we have:       Perfect Squares.  A Perfect Square is a special kind of trinomial that can be factored into the square of a binomial. There are two forms of perfect square identities:             In these identities, the expression on the left is a perfect square, which means it can be written as the square of a binomial (a two-term expression). The first identity is used when the middle term is positive, and the second identity is used when the middle term is negative.   (Using the first identity)     Consider the quadratic below:     Here, and The square roots of and are and respectively. The middle term is which fits the formula for a perfect square with a negative middle term. Applying the identity: So, factors into      (Using the second identity)     Using the quadratic below:     Here, and The square roots of and are and , respectively. The middle term is , which matches the formula for a perfect square trinomial with a negative middle term. Applying the identity: So, factors into       Factoring Quadratic.  Factoring quadratic expressions involves expressing a quadratic equation in the form of two binomials. A general quadratic equation looks like: To factor a quadratic, we find two numbers and such that:    (the product of and ),     (the coefficient of )   Once we find and , we break the middle term into two terms using and , then factor by grouping.      Cosider:     In this example and We need two numbers that when multiplylied it gives and when the the two values are added up they give These two numbers are and              Now, rewriting the middle term as and then factor by grouping Grouping the terms: Factoring each groups or movng common factor of each and create brackets: Now, factor out the common binomials: Finally, factors to         Use the quadratic identities to write down the expansions of each of the following expressions:                                                       Factorisation Of Quadratic Expressions.   Factorisation is the process of breaking down a quadratic expression into a product of simpler binomials.    Factorisation When The Coefficient Of Is One  The expression where are constants and , is called a quadratic expression.  In such expressions is called the coefficient of , is called the coefficient of and is called the constant term.  When the coefficient of is one, the expression is of the form;   Cosider the following expressions:           Expanding the expressions we get:  Collecting like terms to get:      Expanding the expressions we get:  Simplify the middle terms:    From the above examples, we can see that the expressions and are formed from the factors of expressions and respectively.  The factorised form of the expression is where and are the factors of whose sum is .  In each case;   The sum of the constant terms in the factors is equal to the coefficient of in the expression.    The product of the constant terms in the factors is equal to the constant term in the expression.         Factorise the following expression:     In this case, the coefficient of is one, the coefficient of is 5 and the constant term is 6.  So the factors will be of the form where and are the factors of 6 whose sum is 5.  In the expression , look for two numbers such the numbers and such that is coefficient of and is the constant term.  In this case, the numbers are 2 and 3.     Grouping terms, we get:        Therefore, the factorised form of the expression is .

The general form of a quadratic expression is , where , and are constants.  In this section we are going to discuss how to factorise a quadratic expression when the in is not equal to .  Consider the following identities:                                              From the above examples, we can see that the factorisation of a quadratic expression when the coefficient of is not one is similar to the factorisation of a quadratic expression when the coefficient of is one.  Factors are multiplied to get the final expresions on the righthand side (RHS) of the equations.   Given the quadratic expressions on the right-hand side of the equation, how can you factor them?   Consider the expression .  The problem can factorised as follows:     Look for two numbers such that:   Their product is equal to the product of the coefficient of and the constant term, i.e. .  In this case is the coefficient of and is constant term.    Their sum is , where is the coefficient of .  The terms are and        Rewrite the term as the sum of the two numbers found in step (i)(b) .  Thus,                Factorise the expression .    Multiply the coefficient of (which is 12) by the constant term (which is 6):   Find two numbers that multiply to give and add up to . The two numbers are and . and   Splt the middle term using these two numbers:   Factor by grouping: Group the factors:         Factorise the expression .    The expression can be factorised as follows:   Look for two numbers such that:   Their product is equal to the product of the coefficient of and the constant term, i.e. .  In this case is the coefficient of and is constant term.    Their sum is , where is the coefficient of .  The terms are and        Rewrite the term as the sum of the two numbers found in step 1.  Thus,                 Factorise the following expressions:                                                                                                                   Formation of Quadratic Equations by Factorisations.  Any equation of the form where are constants and is known as a quadratic equation. In this section, solutions of quadratic equations using the factor method is discussed.  To solve a quadratic equation by factorisation, we aim to rewrite the quadratic equation in the form of: where and are numbers that, when multiplied, give the product (the constant term), and when added, give the sum (the coefficient of the middle term).  To solve a quadratic eaquation, first ensure the equations is in the form; if not in the form rearrange, so that all terms are on one side of the equation and the equation equals zero.  Factor the quadratic expression:   Look for two numbers that when multiplied give (the coefficient of )    And, when added give (the coefficient of the middle term).   If the quadratic has a leading coefficient , you only need to find two numbers that multiply to and add to .    If , find two numbers that multiply to and add to .        Rewrite the middle term using these two numbers and factor by grouping, which you will have a quadratic of the form:        Solve     Factoring the left hand side (L.H.S) of the equation. The factors are .   Now create common factors Grouping them together we have:         Form a quadratic expression using the factoring method.     To form a quadratic expression using the factoring method, first set the expression equal to to form a quadratic equation:   Remove the common factor out and form a bracket:   Thus, the factored form of expression is;           Form a quadratic expression using the following expressions.                                                                            Solutions Of Quadratic Equations By Factorisations.  In our previous sections we have discussed the form of a quadratic expression, identities and quadratic equations; how to form quadratic equations and differentiate between an expression and equation  In this section we are going to learn about the solving the factored equation, we are going to continue from the point where we form factored equation  Numbers that satisfy an equation (its solutions) are called the roots of the equation.  Once you have factored the quadratic into the form; Set each factor equal to zero and solve for :             Solving these will give the two solutions for .      Solve     Look for two numbers that if multiplied by and when added up gives   These numbers are and So we can write the equation as: Finding a common factor we have: Grouping we have th factors of the equation as:   Setting each factor equal to zero (0).             Solving for              Thus, the solutions to the quadratic equation are;         Solve,     We need 2 numbers to form factors, which when;   Multiplied to     Added up gives      These numbers are and So rewrite the middle part. Grouping the factors: Factor each group:   Set each factor eaqual to zero:             Solving for              Thus, the solutions to are:        Solve the quadratic equation by factorisation.

Form a quadratic equation and solve it to find the number.    Solve the quadratic equation:     A garden's area is 56 square meters, and its length is 4 meters more than its width. Form and solve a quadratic equation to find the dimensions of the garden.           Application Of Quadratic Equations To Real Life Situations.   Quadratic equations are a type of mathematical equation that can be used to describe many different real-life situations. Whether you're throwing a ball in the air, trying to maximize the area of a garden, or calculating profits for a business, quadratic equations can help solve problems that involve relationships with squared terms.  In this section, we will learn how to recognize real-life situations that can be modeled by quadratic equations, how to set them up, and how to solve them step by step.  A quadratic equation is an equation that can be written in the form: where,    , and are real numbers or constants,     is the unknown variable    and beacuse if is it would npt be a quadratic     Quadratic equations show up in many situations, especially when something is changing in a way that involves squares (like height, area, or profit).  Lets take a look at some of the situations Quadratic Equations is involved in real life situations.     One of the most common real-life situations for quadratic equations is projectile motion , such as when you throw a ball in the air. The height of the ball over time can be described by a quadratic equation.     Quadratic equations are also used in optimization problems. These are problems where you want to maximize or minimize something, like the area of a garden.    A rock is dropped from a height of meters. Its height above the ground at time is given by Use factorization to determine how long it will take for the rock to reach the ground.    The height of the rock above the ground is given by:   To find when the rock reaches the ground, set :   Simplify the equation:    Solve for :   Since time cannot be negative, .  Therefore, the rock will take approximately seconds to reach the ground.        The length of a rectangle is meters more than its width. If the area of the rectangle is square meters, find the dimensions of the rectangle by factoring the quadratic equation.    Let the width of the rectangle be . Then the length is .  The area of the rectangle is given by:   Expand and rearrange into standard quadratic form:   Factorize the quadratic equation:   Solve for :   Since width cannot be negative, .  The dimensions of the rectangle are: Since the width cannot be negative, the width is meters, and lenght is meters.       Businesses often use quadratic equations to model their profit. For example, the profit a company makes from selling a product can be modeled by a quadratic equation.      A company's profit from selling units of a product is given by the equation: Find how many units the company needs to sell to have no profit (i.e., when the profit is zero).    To find when the company has no profit, set :   Multiply through by to simplify:   Factorize the quadratic equation:   Solve for :   Therefore, the company will have no profit when it sells either units or units.       A stone is thrown into the air from a height of meters with an initial velocity of meters per second. The height of the stone at time is given by: Find when the stone reaches the ground.      A farmer has meters of fencing. He wants to build a rectangular garden. The length is meters longer than the width. What should the dimensions be to maximize the area?      A school's profit function is given by: Find the number of units the company must sell to achieve zero profit.      A water fountain shoots water into the air, and its height at any time (in seconds) is given by the equation: Find the time it will take for the water to return to the ground (i.e., when ).      Solve the following quadratic equation: Find the value of       A company finds that the revenue it generates from selling units of a product is given by the quadratic equation: Find the number of units that the company needs to sell to maximize its revenue.      The path of a car is represented by the quadratic equation where represents time in seconds and represents the car's position. Find the time when the car reaches its starting position by factorizing the equation.      "

Enlargement is a transformation that increases the size of a shape. The shape is enlarged by a scale factor. The scale factor is used to multiply the length of each side of the shape to get the length of the corresponding side of the enlarged shape.

The scale factor of this enlargement is . In an enlargement, the object and its image remain similar. The linear scale factor of the enlargement determines the proportional transformation.  Lines connecting object points to their corresponding image points intersect at the center of enlargement. This property helps in determining the center of enlargement when both the object and its image are given.

Scale Factors      Scale factor is a fundamental concept in mathematics, especially in geometry, where it is used to describe the proportional relationship between similar figures.    It is defined as the ratio of corresponding side lengths in two similar shapes.    Understanding scale factor helps students grasp how objects are enlarged or reduced while maintaining their shape and proportions.       Area Scale Factor  Area scale factor is the ratio of the area of the image to area of the object.  In the Figures below, the parallelogram represents the enlarged image of paralellogram , transformed by a scale factor of .                  Area scale factor is the square of linear scale factor.      A square whose area is  is given an enlargement with a linear scale factor of .Find the area of the image.

Calculate the length of a similar parallelogram whose area is .      The area of a circle is . A second circle has a radius that is times the radius of the first circle. What is the area of the second circle?       Volume Scale Factor  The volume scale factor refers to the ratio by which the volume of a three-dimensional object is scaled when the object's dimensions (length, width, height) are scaled by a certain factor.  If the linear dimensions of an object are scaled by a factor of , the volume of the object will be scaled by a factor of . This is because volume is a cubic measurement.

(a).What is the volume of the small cube?  (b).What is the volume of the larger cube?  (c). By what factor has the volume increased when the small cube is scaled to the larger cube?        Application of Similarity and Enlargement  Similarity and enlargement are key concepts in geometry, particularly when it comes to shapes, figures, and their properties. Here are some practical applications of these concepts:  (i)   In architecture, architects often use enlargement and similarity to create scale models of buildings, bridges, or other structures. By maintaining the same proportions but adjusting the size, architects can test designs or present ideas in a more manageable form.  Similarity is used to create blueprints for large structures. These blueprints are scaled-down versions of the final building, preserving the ratio of dimensions in the original structure.  Suppose an architect is designing a scale model of a building. The actual building is tall, and the architect creates a scale model where the height of the model is .To find the scale factor, use the formula for similarity:  scale factor   Scale factor   So, the scale factor is , meaning the model is the size of the actual building. This scale factor ensures that the proportions are similar.  (ii)   Let's say a map is drawn with a scale of , meaning unit on the map represents units in real life. If a road is long on the map, how long is the actual road?  We can calculate the actual length using the scale factor:  Actual Length = Length on map scale factor  Actual length      An architect is creating a scale model of a building. The actual height of the building is meters, and the height of the model is meters.  (a) What is the scale factor of the model?  (b) If the width of the actual building is meters, what is the width of the model?      A map scale is given as , meaning on the map represents in real life.  (a) A river on the map measures in length. What is the actual length of the river in kilometers?  (b) If a road on the map measures , how long is the actual road in meters?      A photograph has a size of by . It needs to be enlarged so that the width becomes . The height will also increase proportionally. What is the new height of the photograph after the enlargement?      A pole of height meters casts a shadow of length meters. A tree casts a shadow of length meters.  (a) Using the concept of similar triangles, find the height of the tree.  (b) If the tree's shadow increases to meters, what would be the new height of the tree, assuming the proportion remains the same?      "

  "title": "Reflection and Congruence",
  "body": " Reflection and Congruence   Reflection and congruence are two powerful concepts that shape much of what we see and do around us.  Reflection is a geometrical transformation whereby an object is flipped across a line of reflection to create a mirror image. Reflection is all about symmetry, that is, the similarity in shape and size when an object is cut, flipped or folded.  Congruence means there is similarity in shape and size of an object or figure.  There are a wide range of application of reflection and congruence in real life. For instance:     Reflection is used in science and medicine to create medical images like ultrasounds, of internal body organs. The reflection of sound waves helps create images of internal organs.    Tailors use the concept of congruence in designing clothes. This is because patterns for clothing rely on congruent pieces for proper fitting and symmetry. For instance when you look at the arms a t-shirt or sweater, you will notice the similarity in size and shape (congruence).       Identifying lines of symmetry given an object  Here is an activity to introduce you to the concept of symmetry.   From a piece of paper, cut out a square shape and label it as shown below.   Square    Fold the square in half from left to right such that the corner aligns with corner and corner aligns with corner This will create a rectangle.  Unfold the paper and make a dotted line across the fold line and label it as as shown.   Square    Notice that the left side of the line and the right side are exacly the same\/ identical.  Now, fold the square in half from the top to the bottom such that the corner aligns with corner and corner aligns with corner This will create another rectangle.  Unfold the paper and make a dotted line across the second fold line and label it as as shown.   Square    Again, you notice that the upper side of the line and the lower side are exacly the same\/ identical.  Next, fold the paper in half from the bottom left corner to the top right corner This creates a triangle.  Unfold the paper, you will notice that a fold line appears along Trace a dotted line along the fold line as showm.   Square    Finally, fold the paper in half from the top left corner to the bottom right corner This creates another triangle.  Now, unfold the paper, you will notice that a fold line appears along Trace a dotted line along the fold line as showm.   Square    There are four dotted lines Both sides of each line are exactly the same.  Therefore symmetry is when an object\/shape looks exactly similar or identical on one side and the other side when the object is folded\/flipped, rotated or reflected.  The four dotted lines are known are the lines of symmetry. Therefore, a square has lines of symmetry.  A line of symmetry divides an object or shape into similar\/ identical parts, that is, one half is the mirror image of the other half.      Cut out the following shapes from a paper and find the number of lines of symmetry in each.                              Discuss your findings with other learners.     Identify lines of symmetry in the alphabetical letters below   alphabets     alphabets-2     alphabets-3        Plane of symmetry  When you cut a banana vertically into two equal halves such that one half is the reflection of the other half, you create a plane of symmetry of the banana.  Therefore, a plane of symmetry is an imaginary flat surface that divides an object into two equal halves, such that one half is the mirror image of the other half.   Consider the activity below illustrating plane of symmetry of a cube.                                    There are planes of symmetry in a cube as you can see in the images above.      vertical planes of symmetry.     horizontal plane of symmetry.     diagonal planes of symmetry.         How many planes of symmetry are there in the following geometrical objects.     Sphere.    Triangular prism.    Rectangular prism.    Cone.    Cylinder.          Properties of reflection   Reflection is the mirror image of an object over a line (line of reflection)    Exploring reflections with mirrors (Work in groups)   Needed Materials      A small mirror.    Marker or pencil.    Piece of paper.      Steps.      Hold your hand about in front of the mirror, with your palm facing the mirror. What do you notice?    Turn your hand so that the back of your hand faces the mirror instead. Observe again. How does the reflection mimic the shape of your hand? Is there symmetry between your hand and its relection?    Hold your hand in front of the mirror with your palm facing the mirror, then fold your fingers to make a fist. Does the reflection mimic your hand movements in the same direction?    Slowly rotate your hand in different directions (up, down, sideways) while watching the mirror. Discuss how the mirror's reflection always mirrors the real movement.    Move your hand closer to the mirror until it touches the mirror. What do you notice?      Discussion      The mirror does not create a random image but produces a reversed copy of the object in front of it. From your activity, you will notice that when you hold your right hand in front of the mirror, the reflection is a reverse which appers as the left hand. This phenomena is called lateral inversion. Lateral inversion is when a reflected object appears to be flipped along a vertical axis.    You will also notice that the reflection mimics you hand movements when you flip, rotate it and when you fold it.    As you move your hand closer to the mirror, you notice that the distance between reflection and the mirror reduces. When you touch the mirror, the image appears to touch your hand. Your hand and its reflection are in symmetry.          Identify the parts of your body are the mirror images of one another.      Draw a letter on a paper using a marker. Show it to the mirror. Observe how the mirror flips the image.       Reflection of different shapes on a plane   Here is a step by step approach on reflection of a triangle on a plane      Draw a perpendicular line from vertex to the mirror line and measure the distance by counting the number of squares between vertex and the mirror line Repeat this process for vertices      Determine the position of the reflected vertices. For vertex the perpendicular distance between the vertex and the mirror line is squares. Count squares from the mirror line to the opposite side of the mirror line and mark that point as which is the reflected image of vertex Repeat the same procedure the remaining vertices      Connect the reflected vertices to create the reflected image of the triangle    Reflected triangle       Draw the image of the pentagon under the reflaction on the diagonal mirror line        To obtain the image of draw a perpendicular line from to the mirro line extend the line the same distance on the opposite side of the mirror line and mark the point as Similarly, obtain the images the images of vertices respectively.  Connect the images of the vertices to form the reflection of the pentagon.        Discussion.      Reflection moves the image of an object across the mirror line, that is, to the opposite side of the mirror line.    A point on the object is the same distance as its reflection from the mirror line.    The line connecting a point to its image is perpendicular to the mirror line. Therefore, the mirror line is the perpendicular bisector of the lines connecting the object points and the image points.        Copy the figures below and draw their images under the reflection on the mirror line                  Reflect the object about the y-axis         The vertices of a polygon are given as: A(-5,5), B(-6,3), C(-5,1), D(-3,0), E(-2,2) and F(-3,4). Find the image of the polygon under the following reflection lines:      followed by                Determining the equation of a mirror line ( line of reflection) given an object and its image   Determine the line of reflection that created the reflected image below.   Line of reflection    Copy the figure above on a graph paper  Fold your graph paper such that the points of the objects match with their respective images. Where does the fold line appear?   Discussion      You notice that the fold line appears exactly on the y-axis. Therefore, the line of reflection is the y-axis.    A line of reflection can be defined with there equation. From the activity, the equation of the line of reflection is         Determine the equation of the line of reflection.   Line of reflection      The coordinates of are at tells you that the line of reflection passes through   Connect point with a line. The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of   From the properties of reflection, the distance from the object to the mirror line is the same as that of mirror line to the image. Therefore, the line of reflection passes through the midpoint of the line connecting   Coordinates for and that of The mid point of line is:   Since you know that the line of reflection passes through the gradient of the reflection line is:   Therefore taking points the equation of the line of reflection is :           Determine if the transformation is a reflection.

Congruence   Here is an activity to explore on congruence  Trace and cut out the following shapes on a piece of paper.      Match two shapes by aligning them directly on top of each other. Discuss how the sides and angles perfectly overlap.  Flip one shape (like turning it over) and try to align it with another shape. Discuss how the shapes still match in size and angles, even though one is flipped.     Identify the figures with the same shape.    Identify the figures with the same size.    Identify figure with same size and shape.      Discussion      Figure with the same size and shape are said to be congruent.     The symbol for congruence is For example, in your activity,     Also, fits directly on without flipping, thus are said to be directly congruent. Identify other figures that are directly congruent.     do not fit directly but when you flip (lateral inversion) figure and fit it on they align. This is called opposite congruence. Identify other figure that have opposite congruence from your activity.    Figures with the same shape but different size are said to be similar.     Congruence can also be applied to line segments and angles.         Identify figures that are:     Directly congruent.    Oppositely congruent.    Similar.             Congruence tests for triangles   Congruence in triangles depends on the measurement of the sides and angles.  Two triangles are said to be congruent if a pair of the corresponding sides and corresponding angles are equal.    Conditions for congruence in triangles   1. SSS Criterion    SSS stands for side-side-side.   In this criterion, the three sides of one triangle is equal to the three sides of the corresponding triangle.  In the figure below:     Side is equal to side     Side is equal to side     Side is equal to side         Since the two triangles meet the SSS criterion,    2. SAS Criterion    SAS stands for side-angle-side.   In this criterion, two sides and an included angle of one triangle is equal to the two corresponding sides and the included angle of the other triangle.  In the figure below:     Side is equal to side     Side is equal to side      is equal to         Therefore, by SAS criterion,    3. ASA Criterion    ASA stands for angle-side-angle.   In this criterion, one side and two included angles of one triangle is equal to the corresponding side and the two included angles of the other triangle.     Side is equal to side      is equal to      is equal to         Therefore, by ASA criterion,    4. RHS Criterion    RHS stands for right angle-hypotenuse-side.   In this criterion, one side and the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and the corresponding side of another right-angled triangle.     Side is equal to side     Side is equal to side      is equal to      By RHS criterion, and sides is equal to side  Therefore, this means that      Therefore, by RHS criterion,    5. AAS Criterion    AAS stands for angle-angle-side.   In this criterion, one side and two included angles of one triangle is equal to the corresponding side and the two included angles of the other triangle.     Side is equal to side      is equal to      is equal to         Therefore, by AAS criterion,     Check if the triangles below are congruent and state the test of congruence criterion.       From the figure, identify corresponding sides and angles.  Sides      Therefore, by SAS criterion       Check if the triangles below are congruent and state test of congruence criterion.         Show that if           "

Now, unfold the paper, you will notice that a fold line appears along Trace a dotted line along the fold line as showm.   Square    There are four dotted lines Both sides of each line are exactly the same.  Therefore symmetry is when an object\/shape looks exactly similar or identical on one side and the other side when the object is folded\/flipped, rotated or reflected.  The four dotted lines are known are the lines of symmetry. Therefore, a square has lines of symmetry.  A line of symmetry divides an object or shape into similar\/ identical parts, that is, one half is the mirror image of the other half.  "

Hold your hand about in front of the mirror, with your palm facing the mirror. What do you notice?    Turn your hand so that the back of your hand faces the mirror instead. Observe again. How does the reflection mimic the shape of your hand? Is there symmetry between your hand and its relection?    Hold your hand in front of the mirror with your palm facing the mirror, then fold your fingers to make a fist. Does the reflection mimic your hand movements in the same direction?    Slowly rotate your hand in different directions (up, down, sideways) while watching the mirror. Discuss how the mirror's reflection always mirrors the real movement.    Move your hand closer to the mirror until it touches the mirror. What do you notice?      Discussion      The mirror does not create a random image but produces a reversed copy of the object in front of it. From your activity, you will notice that when you hold your right hand in front of the mirror, the reflection is a reverse which appers as the left hand. This phenomena is called lateral inversion. Lateral inversion is when a reflected object appears to be flipped along a vertical axis.    You will also notice that the reflection mimics you hand movements when you flip, rotate it and when you fold it.    As you move your hand closer to the mirror, you notice that the distance between reflection and the mirror reduces. When you touch the mirror, the image appears to touch your hand. Your hand and its reflection are in symmetry.      "

  "body": " Rotation  Rotation is a transformation that turn a shape around a fixed point but its size and shape are not changed. Rotations are sometimes called turns. Examples of rotations include the minute needle of a clock, merry-go-round, e.t.c.  In this section, We will learn about rotations about a point, including how to describe rotations.   Properties of Rotation  In the figure 2.3.1 below, triangle is the image of triangle under a transformation         We create the image of by turning around point by in anticlockwise direction. The same process is applied to , resulting in , and to , generating its corresponding image. This consistent turning of points around a fixed center is called a rotation. In this case, point is the centre rotation and angle is the angle of rotation.        A rotation in the anticlockwise direction is taken to be positive i.e a rotation of anticlockwise is     A rotation in the clockwise direction is taken to be negative i.e a rotation of clockwise is     In general, for a rotation to be completely defined, the centre and angle of rotation must be stated.         The coordinates of the vertices for triangle that can be graphed in the coordinate plane are , and as shown below. The triangle is rotated through in a clockwise direction about the origin to produce triangle .Copy the figure and draw triangle                      Centre and Angle of Rotation    Work in pairs.  In the figures below, the triangle is the image of triangle after rotation. Find the centre and angle of rotation        In order to determine the centre and angle of rotation we have to follow the following steps:     Trace the figure. Join to and construct a perpendicular bisector to     Join to and construct a perpendicular bisector to     Also you can join to and construct a perpendicular bisector to   The point where the perpendicular lines intersect is the centre of rotation..    Join to and . Measure . This is the                  Triangle is the image of triangle under a rotation through in anticlockwise direction.       In the figure below, triangle is the image of triangle under a rotation, centre      (a). By construction,find and lebel the centre of roration.  (b) Determine the angle of rotation.        Rotation on Different Planes   Rotation on different planes\" refers to the concept of rotating an object or point around various axes within different planes in a three-dimensional space.    Rotation in the Cartesian Plane    , , and   In the figure below shows triangle and its images after rotations about the origin with different angles of rotation.                                                                                                      The image of triangle remains the same when rotated through (clockwise or counterclockwise) about the origin.    A rotation through and about the origin does not change the position of the object.     Consider a point which is rotated through the indicated angles about the origin in the table below.                                Consider a point .We are required to finding the coordinates of its image after a Rotation taking the centre to be and angle of rotation to be ;   is mapped onto .  Given the point and the centre of rotation , To obtain this point without a graph, We follow this steps;     from the given points, for point ,We let and and for the given centre we let and .     Considering the same point , but now the angle of rotation to be ; To find the coordinates of its image we follow the following steps:  Given the point and the centre of rotation , To find the point of the image we follow the following steps;            A triangle with coordinates , and is rotated through the centre and angle of in a clockwise direction.Find the coordinates of its image    Since triangle is rotated in a clockwise direction with an angle of through the origin, then the angle of rotation is   According to the rule, If we have our points which will be mapped to if rotated through the centre and angle of rotation is   Therefore, we will individually apply the rotation formula to all three given points.     The coordinates of triangle are , and       A point maps onto under a rotation R centre . Find the angle of rotation.    Describe the rotation which maps the rectangle whose verticies are , , and onto a rectangle whose verticies are , , and     Give the coordinates of the image of each of the following points when rotated through in a clockwise direction about    (a) (4,-2)  (b) (-2,2)  (c) (4,4)  (d) (-2,-1)  (e) (-3,2)      Find the coordinates of the verticies of the image of a triangle whose verticies are , and when rotated about the origin through:   (a)   (b)   (c)        The parallelogram whose verticies are , , and is rotated to give an image whose verticies are , , and . Find the centre and angle of rotation.        Rotational Symmetry    Rotational symmetry refers to the property of an object where it can be rotated (turned) around a central point and still look the same. In other words, if you spin the shape around its center, it matches its original position multiple times in a full rotation.    Determining the order of rotational symmetry of plane figures   Here is a fun activity to introduce you to rotatonal symmetry.   Materials      A printed copy of the figure.    Pncils, push pin.    Constuction paper.    Pair of scissors.         Instructions      On a construction paper, trace and cut the figure above.    Place the tracing on top the printed copy and place a pin through their centre such that the tracing can rotate.    Manually rotate the tracing around the centre and note how many times the shape looks exactly the same in one full turn       Discussion   The number of times the tracing of the star fits onto the printed copy in one complete turn is times. This is called the order of symmetry, that is, the number of times the figure fits onto itself in one complete turn.  When given a figure with the measure of the angle between the identical parts, the order of rotational symmetry can be computed as shown.        Find the order of rotational symmetry in the figure below.                     State the order of symmetry in the figures below.                            Find the order of rotational symmetry in the letters of the alphabet.       Determining the axis of rotation and order of rotational symmetry in solids   1. Triangular prism   A solid has rotational symmetry if it can be rotated about a fixed straight line and still appears to be the same.  The straight line around which the object is rotated is called axis of rotation.   The figure below shows a triangular prism whose cross-section is an equialteral triangle.  The axis of rotation passes through the traingular face. Therefore, the order of rotation through this axis is      The prism also has other axes of rotation with each axis having orders of rotational symmetry as shown in the figure below:      2. Cone   A cone has one axis of rotation with infinite numbers of order of rotational symmetry since its base is circular.      3. Regular tetrahedron   A regular tetrahedron has 3 axes of rotational symmetry. These axes pass through each vertex and the centroid of the opposite face.  For the regular tetrahedron below, the axis of rotational symmetry are as follows:     An axis through and passing at the center of the face     An axis through and passing at the center of the face     An axis through and passing at the center of the face     An axis through and passing at the center of the face      For each axis of rotation in the tetrahedron, the tetrahedrom fits the original position times in one full rotation.          Rotation and Congruence  Congruence refers to a relationship between two figures or objects, whereby, they are identical in size and shape.  Rotation is a type of transformation that repositions an object but preserves the shape and size of the object. Thus, rotation produces congruent figures.    Triangle is mapped onto after a rotation of and centre of rotation          have the same shape and size.    The length of the corresponding sides of are the same.    Every corresponding internal angle for the triangles remain the same.     Therefore, are said to be directly congruent.        Identify the axes of rotational symmetry and their respective order in the following:     Cylinder    Rectangular pyramid    Sphere    Cube         Identify the axes of rotational symmetry and their respective order for the following figures:              "

  "body": " Trigonometry 1   By the end of this topic, you will be able to:      - Define and apply sine, cosine, and tangent to solve right-angled triangle problems.     - Use the theorem to determine unknown sides in right-angled triangles.     - Use trigonometric ratios and special angle values ( ) to find missing angles or sides.     - Solve practical problems such as determining the height of a building, the angle of elevation, or distances indirectly.        Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. It is primarily concerned with right-angled triangles and uses trigonometric functions such as (sine), (cosine), and (tangent) to describe these relationships.  Right-angled triangles can be found in various real-life structures and objects. Some examples include:     Staircases    Roof structures    Ladders against a wall    Bridges and ramps    Tree shadows         Trigonometric ratios of acute angles   An acute angle is an angle that measures greater than 0° but less than 90° . In other words, it is an angle that is smaller than a right angle (90°).   Examples of Acute Angles     30°, 45°, and 60° are common acute angles in trigonometry.     Characteristics of Acute Angles     They are always found in right-angled triangles.  The sum of two acute angles in a right-angled triangle is always 90° because the third angle is the right angle (90°).  They appear in various geometric shapes like triangles, polygons, and real-world structures.      Tangent of an Acute Angle  The inclination of the observer's line of sight to the top of a high flag pole, positioned away, can be determined using a scale drawing, as illustrated in the diagram below, the inclination (angle of elevation) is represented by the angle .             What you require: A piece of paper, a ruler and a pencil.     Using a piece of paper, a ruler and a pencil, draw the diagram like the one shown below.   fig 1.2       Measure the length .   Show whether the triangle . If they are similar,what do you notice about the ratios of there sides?    Find the ratios of     What do you notice about the ratios of the above figure.  For the parallel lines of that is and , What do you notice about the ratio of vertical distance and the horizontal distance?   Measure the angle represented by   Discuss your findings with other learners in your class.       Essential Concept:   You will notice that when given the triangle below,           Triangle are similar.  This implies that the ratios of sides that is     For any line parallel to , ratio of will be the same in each triangle above that is .  This constant ratio, is called the .  Therefore, tangent of which can be written as .  The tangent of an angle depends on the size of the angle only.     The figure below shows a right-angled triangle , in which .   fig 1.4      The vertical side is opposite angle . The horizontal side is adjacent to angle .  In this scenario, .   Further activity   Express in terms of the lengths of the sides of the triangle Shown above in fig 1.4    Determine the opposite and adjacent sides corresponding to each of the labeled acute angles in the given right-angled triangles below.               The opposite side   The adjacent side     The opposite side   The adjacent side          Find the tangents of the indicated angles using the given measurements below.       The above diagram the sides given are,  Opposite side   Adjacent side   Therefore,     Therefore,       Find the tangent in the indicated angle below.       The first thing you should do is to calculate the perpendicular height of the Triangle then identify the opposite and the adjacent sides of angle and angle . Finaly find there tangents  Finding the perpendicular height.  We use pythagorean relationship that is      Finding      The opposite side   The adjacent side      Finding      The opposite side   The adjacent side      Therefore,          The table of tangents is a mathematical reference table that provides values of the tangent function ( ) for various angles, typically in degrees or radians. It helps in solving trigonometry problems when a calculator is not available. Here's how you can use it:  Special tables have been prepared and can be used to obtain tangents of acute angle (see tables of natural tangents in your mathematical tables). The technique of reading tables of tangents is similar to that of reading tables of logarithms or square roots.  Here's how you can use it:     Identify the angle     Find the given angle in the leftmost column (if degrees) or the top row (if radians).       Locate the Tangent Value     Read across the row (or down the column) to find the corresponding tangent value.         Note      In the tables of tangents, the angles are expressed in decimals and degrees or in degrees and minutes.    One degree is equal to . Thus, .     From the table, the values of tangents increase as the angles approach        What you require: Printed Table of Tangent, a ruler, pencil, and calculator (for verification).     What is the tangent of an angle?    How do we use a Table of Tangents?    Use your Table of Tangent to find the folowing tangents.                            Discuss your findings with other groups in your class.        Find the tangent of each of the following angles from the table:                               Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Convert to degrees by deviding by      Therefore,   Using decimal tables, . From the difference column under reads   Therefore,          Use Natural logarithm of tangents to find the length in the figure below.       Th sides given are,  Adjacent   Opposite      By the formular .  Therefore,   This implies that,   Find using the tangent table, we have that,     Therefore,       Using natural tangents in your mathematical tables, find as shown in the figure below.       Opposite   Adjacent      Note that cannot be read directly from the tables of tangents. Therefore, look for a number nearest to from the tables.

Trigonometric ratios to angles of Elevation and Depression  Trigonometry helps us calculate distances and heights using angles of elevation and depression in real-life situations.  See the figure below;     The dashed line is the horizontal line.      The angle measured upward from a horizontal line to an object above.     The angle measured downward from a horizontal line to an object below.  Angle of elevation and angle of depression are complimentary angle meaning sum of the two angles add up to .     Both angles are measured from an observer’s line of sight and are solved using trigonometric ratios   The angle of elevation and angle of dipression can be measured using a simple clinometer.     A clinometer (or inclinometer) is a tool used to measure the angle of elevation (looking up) and the angle of depression (looking down). Follow these steps to measure angles accurately.   clinometre      (Used when looking up at an object, e.g., the top of a building or tree.)     Stand at a known distance from the object you want to measure.    Hold the clinometer at eye level and look at the top of the object through the sight or thread    Read the angle displayed on the clinometer.    Record the angle as the angle of elevation.    Use trigonometry ( to calculate the object's height if necessary.       If the angle of elevation is and the distance to the object is , then the height ( ) above eye level is:               (Used when looking down at an object, e.g., from a balcony to the ground.)     Stand at a higher position (e.g., a balcony, hill, or raised surface).    Hold the clinometer at eye level and look downward toward the object.    Read the angle shown on the clinometer when pointing at the object.    Record the angle as the angle of depression.    Use trigonometry to calculate distances if needed ( ).       If the angle of depression is and the horizontal distance to the object is , the vertical drop ( ) is:                 What you require:      Measuring tape or meter stick.

Find a Tall ObjeSelect a tall object outdoors (tree, building, flagpole).    Measure the distance from the base of the object to your position. Record this distance.    Use your clinometer to measure the angle of elevation from your eye level to the top of the object. Record the angle.    Draw a right triangle representing the situation. Label the distance you measured, the angle of elevation, and the unknown height of the object.    Decide which trigonometric ratio (sine, cosine, or tangent) you need to use to find the height.    Use the appropriate trigonometric ratio and the measured distance and angle to calculate the height of the object. Show your work    Write down your calculated height.

  "body": " Area of a Part of a Circle   In Grade 8, you learned how to find the area and arc length of a sector.  In this section, you will explore more about the area of different parts of a circle. This includes the area of an annulus, the area of a sector, the area of an annular sector, and the area of intersecting circles. By the end, you will understand how to apply these concepts to real-life situations.    Area of an Annulus     This is an Annulus;    An is the region between two concentric circles (circles that share the same center) with different radii. The area of an annulus is the space enclosed between the outer circle and the inner circle.     An annulus looks like a ring or a donut shape, where:      is the radius of the outer circle.     is the radius of the inner circle.     Since the annulus is just the difference between the two circles, we can calculate its area by subtracting the area of the smaller circle from the area of the larger circle.          The area of a circle is given by the formula:       The area of the outer circle (larger) is:       The area of the inner circle (smaller) is:       The area of the annulus is the difference between the two areas:        Therefore,               What you require: Circular objects (e.g., two different-sized cups, lids, or rings), ruler or measuring tape and pen and paper (or a calculator).

  "body": " Surface Area and Volume of Solids   Surface Area  Surface area is the total area of the exposed or outer surfaces of a prism.  🔹A right prism is a geometric solid that has a polygon as its base and vertical faces perpendicular to the base. The base and top surface are the same shape and size. It is called a “right” prism because the angles between the base and faces are right angles.  🔹 The name given to the solid that is unfolded like this is called a net. When a prism is unfolded into a net, we can clearly see each of its faces.  🔹 We can thereby clearly calculate the surface area by finding the area of each faces and add them all together to get the surface area of the Prism.  🔹 For example, If we are given a cylinder, the top and bottom faces are circles and the curved area is like a rectangle. So when finding it's surface area we find the area of the two circles and the area of the rectangle then we dd all these areas al together to compute yhe cylinder's surface area.    Surface area of Prisms  🔹 A prism is a Geometric object with two identical, parallel bases and straight sides connecting them.  🔹A right prism is a geometric solid that has a polygon as its base and vertical faces perpendicular to the base. The base and top surface are the same shape and size. It is called a “right” prism because the angles between the base and faces are right angles.  🔹 Recall our defination for surface area which is the total area of the exposed or outer surfaces of a prism.  🔹Examples of right prisms are; a cylinder, a rectangular prism, a cube and a triangular prism.   : Rectangular and a cube prism, Triangular Prisms and Cylinders.     A cube is unfolded to into a net made up of 6 identical squares .     Have you ever tried marching colours in a rubik's cube?     Observe the cuboid below whose side is 8cm.            (a).

A cube is a rectangular prism with all sides of equal length.   Rectangular Prism    The surface area of a cuboid is the total area of all six faces of the cuboid.  When learning about area, we calculated the surface area of a cuboid. Since the opposite faces of a cuboid are identical, the surface area of a cuboid can be calculated by finding the area of each face and then adding them together.  In this section, we will calculate the surface area of a cuboid from their nets.

A right pyramid's line between the apex and the centre of the base is perpendicular to the base.    Find the surface area of the following triangular pyramid (correct to one decimal place)    In finding the surface area we need to recall the definations of a net and a prism.  The net of a pyramid consists of a base, which is a polygon that represents the base of the pyramid, and triangular faces that represent the sides of the pyramid.   Net of a Square based Pyramid      Study the pyramid like the one shown below.    use the height slider to increase and decrease the height of the pyramid and observe what happens to the overall shape as the height changes.    move the size of base slider to change the base length of the pyramid and note changes in the base area and overall structure.    Opens and closes the pyramid and observe how the faces move and connect back together.         Draw the net of the pyramid shown below.

It is made up of the curved surface of the cone laid out flat, so that you can see the shape of the cone. The net of a cone is useful for visualizing the shape of the cone and for calculating its surface area and volume.   Net of a Cone      Use slide to change the radius of the base and slider to change height of the cone.    Use the Net slider or press the play button to show how the cone unraps into its net.     cone      Net of a cone         Net of a Cone      If a cone has a height of h and a base of radius r, show that the surface area is:     Sketch and label the cone     Identify the faces that make up the cone          The cone has two faces: the base and the faces makig up a wall.

Materials Needed:  📌 An orange (or any round fruit)  📌 A knife  📌 A flat surface            Cut the orange in half and carefully peel the skin off in small sections.    Try flattening the peels and arrange them to see how they approximate a circle’s area.  📌 When you peel an orange and flatten the pieces, you can see that the peels cover a large area.  📌 This helps visualize why increasing the radius increases the overall amount of space the fruit takes up (its volume).    Cutting the Orange into Sections.  📌 If you cut an orange in half, you can see its cross-section.  📌 If you keep slicing it into smaller spheres, their individual radii determine their volumes.    Why do yopu think oranges or tomatoes or apples etc. are stacking in pyramidal stacks in the market?  📌 Oranges in a fruit market are often packed in pyramidal stacks because spheres fit together efficiently.  📌 The larger the radius, the more space each orange occupies, which directly affects storage and packaging.    Key takeaways  📌 The radius is the most important factor in determining the volume of a sphere.  📌 If the radius doubles, the volume increases by times!  📌 This explains why a slightly bigger orange holds significantly more juice compared to a smaller one.         A sphere has a radius of 6 cm. Find its volume.         A football has a radius of 9 cm. What is the volume of the ball?           A planet has a radius of 1000 km. What's it's volume?          "

Try flattening the peels and arrange them to see how they approximate a circle’s area.  📌 When you peel an orange and flatten the pieces, you can see that the peels cover a large area.  📌 This helps visualize why increasing the radius increases the overall amount of space the fruit takes up (its volume).    Cutting the Orange into Sections.  📌 If you cut an orange in half, you can see its cross-section.  📌 If you keep slicing it into smaller spheres, their individual radii determine their volumes.    Why do yopu think oranges or tomatoes or apples etc. are stacking in pyramidal stacks in the market?  📌 Oranges in a fruit market are often packed in pyramidal stacks because spheres fit together efficiently.  📌 The larger the radius, the more space each orange occupies, which directly affects storage and packaging.    Key takeaways  📌 The radius is the most important factor in determining the volume of a sphere.  📌 If the radius doubles, the volume increases by times!  📌 This explains why a slightly bigger orange holds significantly more juice compared to a smaller one.

What does the flat section of the graph indicate?    Find the velocity during the last .    Calculate the total displacement at the end of .          Interpretation of displacement time graph  The interpretation of the graph depends on its shape and slope:     Slope of the Graph (Gradient) = Velocity     A steeper slope means higher velocity.    A positive slope (upward line) indicates motion in the positive direction.    A negative slope (downward line) means motion in the negative direction.    A zero slope (horizontal line) means the object is at rest (no change in displacement).       Shape of the Graph     Straight Line: Uniform (constant) velocity.    A curved line indicates that the object's velocity is changing, meaning it's accelerating or decelerating.    Flat Line: No movement (object is stationary).       Interpreting Different Sections     A horizontal straight line means the object is stationary (velocity is zero).    A steeper line means the object is moving faster.         Work in groups     Consider the displacement time graph representing distance covered by a motorist traveling from Turkana to Nairobi.       How far was the motorist from the starting point at ?

What is the total displacement at = seconds    Determine the velocity of the car from the graph.          The graph shows a straight line with a constant slope, indicating uniform motion. This means the car is moving at a constant velocity with no acceleration.    From the graph, the displacement at = seconds is meters.    Using the equation of motion:     Therefore, = seconds, the car’s displacement is meters.    Velocity is given by the slope of the displacement-time graph:     This confirms the car's velocity is  .         Use the graph below to answer the questions.        What type of motion is represented by the graph? Explain your reasoning.    If the train continued to accelerate at  , what would be its approximate displacement at = seconds?    What is the displacement of the body at t = 7 seconds?          The graph represents uniformly accelerated motion.  The line on the graph is curved, not straight. This means the object is not moving the same distance each second. Its speed is changing.    Using the equation:     The approximate displacement at = seconds would be meters.               The displacement-time graph below shows a train moving at a constant velocity.     Use th graph to answer the following questions.     What is the displacement at = ?    If the object continued moving for seconds, what would be its total displacement?    What would the graph look like if the object stopped moving after seconds?

At what time did the motorist stop for a break?    Calculate the speed of the motorist between  and  .    What was the speed of the motorist from  and  ?    Find the overall average speed of the entire journey.    Identify a section of the graph where the motorist was stationary.    Describe what happens when the graph has a steeper slope.          Velocity time graph  A velocity-time graph is a graph that shows how an object's velocity (speed with direction) changes over time.        X-Axis (Horizontal Axis): Represents time (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours).    Y-Axis (Vertical Axis): Represents velocity (e.g., m\/s, km\/h).    Slope of the Graph: Represents acceleration (how fast velocity is changing).    Area Under the Graph: Represents displacement (total distance covered).           Horizontal Line:     The object is moving at a constant velocity (zero acceleration).       Upward Sloping Line:     The object is accelerating (velocity is increasing).       Downward Sloping Line:     The object is decelerating (velocity is decreasing).       Line at Zero Velocity:     The object not moving.         Work in groups     A train moving at along a North-South railway track passes through a station R at . The train is decelerating at northward.  Find the velocity of the train:      after      after      after        Determine the average velocity of the train:     In the first after     In the first after        Draw a velocity-time graph, find the distance of the train from R at seconds past         Given the table below      Time            Velocity (m\/s)             Draw the velocity-time graph to represent the data.

A cyclist starts at and increases speed to in .     Draw the Velocity-Time Graph.    calculate the acceleration of the cyclist.    What type of motion is represented by the velocity-time graph you drew?           Relative Speed    Relative speed is a simple concept that helps us understand how fast one object is moving compared to another object. It's important because sometimes objects are moving at different speeds, and we need to figure out how quickly they are closing the gap between them or moving away from each other.  Consider a case where two bodies moving in the same direction at different speeds. Their is the difference between the individual speeds.  But if they are moving toward each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.    When Objects Move in the Same Direction   Work in Groups.  In this activity you are required to work and groups and follow each step as listed.   Requirements:    Toy car (that can be pulled by a string).    String (long enough for the car to travel a sufficient distance).    Stopwatch or timer    Measuring tape or marked distance on the ground (e.g., 10 meters)    Pen and paper (for recording results)    Observers (to track the race and help evaluate results)    Calculator (optional, for calculations)    Steps:    Find a straight line or pathway that is clear and suitable for the race (a hallway, classroom floor, long corridor or outside on a field).    Measure out a distance for the race, such as 10 meters. You can use a measuring tape or use a marked area to set the starting and finishing points.    Mark the starting line and the finish line clearly, so both the toy car and the student know where to start and end.    Attach one end of the string securely to the toy car. The other end of the string should be held by a participant or fixed to an anchor (like a pole or sturdy object) so that when the student pulls the string, the car moves along the line and test the toy car to ensure that it moves easily along the straight path when the string is pulled.    You will have two participants: one student (who will walk) and one toy car (which will be pulled by the string).    Assign at least one observer to track the race. The observer(s) will help measure the time it takes for each participant (the student and the toy car) to reach the finish line.    Place the student and the toy at the starting line. The student should be ready to walk at a constant speed.    On the count of \"Go!\", the student starts walking in a straight line towards the finish line. At the same time, the person holding the string should start pulling the toy car in the same direction (straight line) at a constant speed. The toy car should be pulled in a way that resembles a consistent movement, not too fast or too slow.    The observers should start the stopwatch as soon as both participants begin moving and stop it when either the student or the toy car reaches the finish line.    Record the time taken by both the student and the toy car to reach the finish line. If you have more than one observer, make sure they agree on the recorded times.    After the race, you need to calculate the relative speed between the student and the toy car.   Let's say the student took seconds to cover the distance ( meters), and the toy took seconds to cover same distance    The speed of the student is: The speed of the toy car is:     If the student and the toy car are moving in the same direction, the relative speed can be given as:        Compare and share your fndings with other groups of both the student and the toy car.    Discuss;   Who moved faster? Was the student walking faster or slower than the toy car?    Why one object might have moved faster than the other. Did the toy car move faster because it was pulled, or was the student faster in their walking?    The relative speed: How does the speed of each participant relate to the other? Did they move away from each other, or did they move closer together?       Now try the activity in different conditions or compare vraious speed by repeating the race multiple times.   Have the student walk faster or slower.    Change the length of the race to see how it affects the results.    Adjust how fast the toy car is pulled.           A cyclist is riding at a speed of  km\/h , and a motorcycle is moving at a speed of  km\/h on the same road in the same direction. If the cyclist starts meters ahead of the motorcycle, how long will it take for the motorcycle to overtake the cyclist?    Since the objects are moving in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed by subtracting the cyclist's speed from the motorcycle's speed:         Now letes convert relative speed to meters per second, so that we can work with the distance in meters, we need to convert the relative speed from km\/h to m\/s.     The initial distance between the motorcycle and the cyclist is 100 meters. To calculate the time it will take for the motorcycle to overtake the cyclist,we have:             A car travels at  km\/h , and a truck travels at  km\/h in the same direction on a straight road. If the car starts meters behind the truck, how long will it take for the car to overtake the truck    The relative speed between the car and the truck is:         Convert Relative Speed to Meters per Second: Convert 15 km\/h to m\/s:    The initial distance between the car and the truck is 150 meters. Use the formula to calculate the time:              A cyclist is riding at a speed of  km\/h , and a motorcycle is traveling at  km\/h on the same road. If the cyclist starts meters ahead of the motorcycle, how long will it take for the motorcycle to overtake the cyclist?      A toy car is being pulled along a straight path at a speed of  m\/s , while a person walks at  m\/s along the same path. If the toy car starts meters ahead of the person, how much time will it take for the person to catch up with the toy car?      Two cyclists are riding along the same road. Cyclist is traveling at  km\/h and Cyclist is traveling at  km\/h . If Cyclist starts meters behind Cyclist , how long will it take for Cyclist to overtake Cyclist ?      A person walks at a speed of  m\/s , and a dog runs at a speed of  m\/s . If the dog starts meters behind the person, how long will it take the dog to catch up with the person?      Two buses are traveling on the same road in the same direction. Bus moves at  km\/h , and Bus moves at  km\/h . If Bus is meters behind Bus , how long will it take for Bus to overtake Bus B?       When Objects Move Toward Each Other (Opposite Directions).   Using Activity 2.9.7. above now try the race such the racers move towards each other such that.   Using the starting and finishing point.   Put the Student on the marked end, and    The Toy car on the other end.       Measure time, record and calculate the speeds.    If the student and the toy car are moving in the same direction, the reative speed is given as;     Discuss;   Who moved faster? Was the student walking faster or slower than the toy car?    Why one object might have moved faster than the other. Did the toy car move faster because it was pulled, or was the student faster in their walking?    The relative speed: How does the speed of each participant relate to the other? Did they move away from each other, or did they move closer together?       Now try the activity in different conditions or compare vraious speed by repeating the race multiple times.   Have the student walk faster or slower.    Change the length of the race to see how it affects the results.    Adjust how fast the toy car is pulled.           A train left town X at  AM and traveled towards town at a speed of  km\/h . A second train left town at  AM and traveled towards town at  km\/h . The distance between town and town is  .   At what time will the two trains meet?    How far from town X will they meet?       The first train departs at  AM , and the second train departs at  AM . Therefore, the first train travels for hour before the second train starts.  The distance traveled by the first train in 1 hour:    Thus, by  AM , the remaining distance between the two trains is: The time it takes for the two trains to meet after 11:00 AM is given by the formula:       This is approximately 1 hr and 17 minutes.   Therefore, the trains will meet at: So the two trains meet at   The distance traveled by the first train before the meeting is:    Thus, the meeting point is approximately from town       Two cyclists start from the same point and travel in opposite directions. One cyclist rides at 20 km\/h, and the other rides at 30 km\/h. After 2 hours, they are 100 km apart.   How long did it take for the cyclists to be 100 km apart?    How far did each cyclist travel?       The cyclists are moving in opposite directions. The total distance between them after hours is  km .  Since the cyclists are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds: In 2 hours, the total distance traveled by both cyclists is:    So, the cyclists will be 100 km apart after 2 hours. This confirms the given information.  The first cyclist, riding at 20 km\/h, travels:    The second cyclist, riding at 30 km\/h, travels:        A motorist left Nakuru for Nairobi, a distance of km, at 8.00 am. and travelled at an average speed of km\/h. Another motorist left Nairobi for Nakuru at  am . and travelled at  km\/h . Find:   The time they met.    How far from Nairobi they met.         A train travels from Mombasa to Nairobi, a distance of  km , at a speed of  km\/h . If a second train starts hour later from Mombasa and travels at a speed of km\/h, after how much time will the second train overtake the first one?      A matatu left town at  am . and travelled towards a town at an average speed of  km\/h . A second matatu left town at  am . and travelled towards town at  km\/h . If the distance between the two towns is  km , find:   The time at which the two matatus met.    The distance of the meeting point from town .         A cyclist is riding towards a motorcyclist on a straight road. The cyclist travels at  km\/h and the motorcyclist at  km\/h . If they are initially meters apart, how long will it take for the motorcyclist to overtake the cyclist?      Two cars, and , are traveling on parallel roads. Car moves at a speed of  km\/h and car moves at  km\/h . If car is meters behind car , how long will it take for car to overtake car ?       "

  "body": " Work in Groups.  In this activity you are required to work and groups and follow each step as listed.   Requirements:    Toy car (that can be pulled by a string).    String (long enough for the car to travel a sufficient distance).    Stopwatch or timer    Measuring tape or marked distance on the ground (e.g., 10 meters)    Pen and paper (for recording results)    Observers (to track the race and help evaluate results)    Calculator (optional, for calculations)    Steps:    Find a straight line or pathway that is clear and suitable for the race (a hallway, classroom floor, long corridor or outside on a field).    Measure out a distance for the race, such as 10 meters. You can use a measuring tape or use a marked area to set the starting and finishing points.    Mark the starting line and the finish line clearly, so both the toy car and the student know where to start and end.    Attach one end of the string securely to the toy car. The other end of the string should be held by a participant or fixed to an anchor (like a pole or sturdy object) so that when the student pulls the string, the car moves along the line and test the toy car to ensure that it moves easily along the straight path when the string is pulled.    You will have two participants: one student (who will walk) and one toy car (which will be pulled by the string).    Assign at least one observer to track the race. The observer(s) will help measure the time it takes for each participant (the student and the toy car) to reach the finish line.    Place the student and the toy at the starting line. The student should be ready to walk at a constant speed.    On the count of \"Go!\", the student starts walking in a straight line towards the finish line. At the same time, the person holding the string should start pulling the toy car in the same direction (straight line) at a constant speed. The toy car should be pulled in a way that resembles a consistent movement, not too fast or too slow.    The observers should start the stopwatch as soon as both participants begin moving and stop it when either the student or the toy car reaches the finish line.    Record the time taken by both the student and the toy car to reach the finish line. If you have more than one observer, make sure they agree on the recorded times.    After the race, you need to calculate the relative speed between the student and the toy car.   Let's say the student took seconds to cover the distance ( meters), and the toy took seconds to cover same distance    The speed of the student is: The speed of the toy car is:     If the student and the toy car are moving in the same direction, the relative speed can be given as:        Compare and share your fndings with other groups of both the student and the toy car.    Discuss;   Who moved faster? Was the student walking faster or slower than the toy car?    Why one object might have moved faster than the other. Did the toy car move faster because it was pulled, or was the student faster in their walking?    The relative speed: How does the speed of each participant relate to the other? Did they move away from each other, or did they move closer together?       Now try the activity in different conditions or compare vraious speed by repeating the race multiple times.   Have the student walk faster or slower.    Change the length of the race to see how it affects the results.    Adjust how fast the toy car is pulled.        "

Collection of data   Data refers to raw facts, figures, or information collected for analysis, reference, or decision-making.  Data collection is the process of gathering information for analysis, interpretation, and decision-making.    Sources of data  Data can be obtained from two main sources:        These are first-hand data collected directly by an individual or organization for a specific purpose.  For examples:    Conducting surveys  Interviews with individuals or groups  Experiments and observations  Group discussions         These are data that have already been collected and recorded by others for a different purpose.  For examples:    Government reports (e.g., census data)  Research articles and journals  Newspapers and magazines  Online databases and records         These are sources that compile and summarize information from primary and secondary sources.  For examples:    Dictionaries  Textbooks  Encyclopedias (e.g., Wikipedia)        Work in groups     Form groups of 3-5 students.    Collect data from both primary and secondary sources based on the topic.     The Most Popular Mode of Transport in Our Community.       Primary Data Collection:     Conduct a short survey by asking at least 10 people what mode of transport they use most often (e.g., walking, bicycles, motorcycles, public buses, private cars).    Record their responses in a table.       Secondary Data Collection:     Find information from newspapers, government reports, or websites about transport statistics in Kenya.       Compare the findings from both sources.    Present your results in a short report or class discussion.      Learning point     Sources of data are where information comes from. First-hand data is collected directly, while second-hand data comes from existing records.       Classify the Following as Primary or Secondary Data Sources:    A student conducts a survey to find out the favorite sports of their classmates.  A teacher uses last year’s national exam results to analyze student performance trends.  A researcher reads a government report on the most common diseases in Kenya.  A doctor observes a patient’s symptoms and records them for a medical study.  A scientist conducts an experiment to test the growth rate of plants under different conditions.        Primary because the student is collecting firsthand data directly from people.  Secondary because the exam results were already collected and recorded by an external body.  Secondary because The report was collected and published by someone else for a different purpose.  Primary because The doctor is directly collecting new data from real-life observation.  Primary because The scientist is generating new data through an experiment.        A community group wants to understand the needs of youth in their area.     What primary data collection methods could the group use?    What problems might they have when trying to find this information?

Data Source  Raw Data  Tertiary Sources  Primary sources        What are the advantages of using secondary data over primary data in some research situations?       Methods of data collection  Different methods are used depending on the type of data needed:     Interviews    A face-to-face or online conversation where the researcher asks specific questions.  Can be structured (fixed questions) or unstructured (flexible discussion).  Used in opinion polls, job research, and investigations.      Questionnaires    A set of written questions distributed to respondents.  Can be open-ended (detailed responses) or closed-ended (fixed choices).  Used in market research, academic studies, and social surveys.      Experiments    Data obtained by conducting controlled tests.  Used in laboratories, product testing, and medical research.      Observations    Data collected by watching and recording behaviors, events, or conditions.  Can be direct (watching people’s actions) or indirect (using cameras, sensors, or recorded data).

Why is it important to keep accurate records when conducting observations?      Give one example of a situation where you would use secondary data collection in a Geography class.        Representing data using a frequency distribution table  A frequency distribution table is a table that organizes data into categories or groups, showing how often each category or range of values appears in a dataset.  There are two types:     Ungrouped Frequency Distribution: for small datasets with individual values.    Grouped Frequency Distribution: for large datasets where values are grouped into intervals.     Frequency refers to the number of times a specific value or range of values appears in a dataset.   Work in groups     Below are the weekly pocket expenses (in Ksh) of a randomly selected group of 25 students.          Prepare a frequency distribution table for the grouped data.    Identify the number with the highest frequency.    Compare your answer with others in class.      Learning points     A tally mark represents a single count, with each mark representing one occurrence.    A frequency table is a table that shows an event and how many times it happens.       The following data represents test scores of students in a grade class.     Prepare a frequency distribution table for the dataset.        Test scores  Tally  Frequency     \/\/                \/\/\/      \/      \/\/\/      \/\/      \/\/          The number of customers visiting a supermarket over days were recorded as follows:        Draw a frequency table to represent the data?    To prepare frequency table for the ungrouped data above, we need to find the class intervals for the data.

This issue affects academic performance, future job opportunities, and the overall development of the community.  Gather data on:     Number of students dropping out per term\/year.    Reasons for dropping out (e.g., poverty, early marriages, lack of school fees, long distances to school).    Feedback from teachers, parents, and students.    Comparison of dropout rates between different classes and gender.        Draw a frequency distribution table for the data.    Calculate mean,median and mode for the data.          Measures of central tendency  Measures of central tendency are statistical values that represent the middle or most frequently occurring number in a dataset.  There are three main measures of central tendency:     Mean  Mean is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values. It is also known as Arithmetic Average.     Where represents the values in the dataset and is the total number of values.    Median  Median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.    Mode  Mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. A dataset can have:    No mode: if no value repeats.  One mode (Unimodal): if one value appears most frequently.  Two modes (Bimodal): if two values appear equally most frequently.  Multimodal: if more than two values appear frequently.        Work in groups     Consider the following data set:       State whether this data is ungrouped or grouped.    Find the Mean, Mode and Median for the data.    Discuss with other groups      Learning point     Measures of central tendency (Mean, Median, and Mode) help find the center of a dataset: Mean is the average, Median is the middle number, and Mode is the most common value.       In a class of students, the test scores of students are:      Find the:     Mean    Median    Mode          The formula for the mean is:     Where;      is the sum of all values     is the total number of values      =         =   Therefore, the mean is     Median  The median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.        Since there are 30 values (even number), the median is;   =       =    =      Therefore the median is     Mode  The mode is the most frequently occurring values.  From the sorted data:      appears times     appears times     Since and appear most frequently, this dataset is bimodal with modes: and .         A company records the monthly salaries (in KES) of employees as follows:                    Find the modal class of the data.       Since the dataset is large, we need to determine appropriate class intervals to identify the modal class in the grouped data.      Salary Range (KES)  Frequency (Number of Employees)                                         The modal class is , since is the one with the highest frequency.

Calculate the median for the price of petrol.      The following dataset shows the monthly electricity bills (in KSH) paid by households in a town.           Convert the datasets into grouped data by creating class intervals.    Find the Mean, Median, and Mode for the dataset.    Identify the Modal Class for a grouped version of the dataset.         In a market, vendors recorded their daily sales (in KSH), which are organized in the table below.      Daily Sales Range (KSH)  Number of Vendors (Frequency)                                    Find the Mean (Average) daily sales.    Determine the Median class interval.    Identify the Modal class (the class with the highest frequency).          Representation of data   Representation of data refers to the various ways in which collected information can be organized, visualized, and interpreted.  Under representation of data we have graphical representation which Uses charts and graphs to visualize data i.e. Histogram and Frequency Polygon.    Drawing Histograms and Frequency polygons of data  Histograms and Frequency Polygons are graphical methods used to represent continuous data. They help in understanding the distribution and patterns of data.     Histogram     A histogram is a graphical representation of grouped data using bars.    Similar to a bar graph, but the bars touch each other because the data is continuous.    Used for continuous numerical data.    The height of each bar represents the frequency (number of occurrences) of data within that range.       Frequency Polygon.     A frequency polygon is a line graph used to represent frequency distributions.    It is created by plotting points at the midpoint of each histogram bar and connecting them with straight lines.    It helps visualize trends in data and compare distributions.         Work in groups     In a school with students, their heights were measured and recorded in the following table.      Height (cm)  Number of Students (Frequency)                               Choose a suitable scale and represent the data on a histogram and a frequency polygon.    Compare and discuss your graphs with other groups.      Learning point     A histogram uses adjacent bars to show frequency distribution, while a frequency polygon connects the midpoints of the bars with a line to show patterns.       A fruit vendor records the number of fruits sold in a day, categorized by quantity. The data is presented in the table below:      Number of Fruits Sold  Frequency (Days)  Midpoint                                   Using appropriate scale, draw a histogram to represent the data.             A logistics company recorded the distances covered by their delivery vehicles over a certain period. The distances are grouped into intervals as follows:      Distance Range (km)  Frequency (Number of Vehicles)                         Use a suitable scale, draw a frequency polygon to represent the data.    First, find the midpoints and record in the table.         Distance Range (km)  Frequency (Number of Vehicles)  Midpoint                                     The table below presents the salary distribution of employees in a company.      Salary Range (KSh)  Frequency                             Draw a histogram and a frequency polygon to represent the data.    To draw a histogram and a frequency polygon, we need to find the frequency density and the midpoint of each class interval.      Salary range(Ksh.)

A local community group recorded the daily rainfall (in millimeters) for the month of April. The data is as follows:        Draw a histogram to represent the rainfall data.      A teacher at Katilu primary school asks students to find out whether Grade 10 students have enough textbooks and suggest ways to improve the situation.     Students should gather data on:     Total number of students in Grade 10.    Number of textbooks available for each subject.    Which specific subjects lack sufficient textbooks.    How often students share textbooks?       Draw a histogram and frequency polygon to represent the data.    Calculate the mean and median.    Identify the Modal Class of the dataset.           Interpretation of data   Interpretation of data is the process of analyzing, organizing, and making sense of collected information to extract meaningful insights. It involves identifying patterns, relationships, and trends to support decision-making and problem-solving.    Interpreting histograms and frequency polygons     Work in groups  The histogram below represent a household's daily water consumption (in liters) recorded over a month.        Determine the day when the water consumption was high.    Determine the day when the water consumption was low.    Discuss and share with other group.      Leaning point     In a histogram, equal class width means all bars have the same width, while unequal class width means bars have different widths to better represent uneven data.       Use the histogram shown below to answer the questions that follows:        Which speed range (class interval) had the highest frequency of vehicles?    Describe the shape of the histogram. Is it symmetrical, skewed.    What does the y-axis represent?    What is the lowest frequency recorded, and for which speed range does it occur?    If the speed limit is 80 km\/h, how many vehicles exceeded this limit based on the histogram?    Based on the histogram, what conclusions can you draw about vehicle speeds on this highway?          The speed range with the highest frequency is 90 km\/h.    The histogram is skewed right (positively skewed). The tail extends further to the right (higher speeds).    The y-axis represents the frequency, which is the number of vehicles recorded in each speed category.    The lowest frequency recorded is 1, and it occurs for the speed range 100 km\/h.    To find this, we need to add the frequencies of all the bars to the right of 80 km\/h.  The frequencies are:     80-89 km\/h: 6    90-99 km\/h: 7    100 km\/h: 1     Total vehicles exceeding 80 km\/h: = vehicles.       Most Common Speed: The most common speed range is around 90 km\/h.    Right Skew: There's a tendency for vehicles to travel at higher speeds, as indicated by the right skew.    Speed Limit Violations: A significant number of vehicles are exceeding the 80 km\/h speed limit.    Lower Speeds: There is a very low frequency of cars travelling at lower speeds. (Below 60km\/h)            The histogram below represents the ages of attendees recorded by the organizers at a community event.        How many age groups are represented in the histogram?    What is the total number of attendees recorded in the histogram?    Which age group has the highest number of attendees?          By counting the number of bars in the histogram, we can determine the number of age groups.  The bars are   Therefore, there were five age groups that attended the event.    The total number of attendees is the sum of all frequencies (heights of the bars).   =   Therefore, the number of attendees were     The age group corresponding to the tallest bar has the highest number of attendees.  Therefore, the age group had the highest number of attendees, with a total of participants.         The graph below represents a histogram and frequency polygon of the distribution of exam scores of students in a Grade 10 class.        Describe the shape of the distribution of exam scores.    What is the midpoint of the class interval ?    Compare the height of the first bar ( score range) to the height of the last bar ( score range). What does this tell you about the number of students in those score ranges?          The distribution is skewed to the right (positively skewed).         The first bar is much taller than the last bar. This means that many more students got scores in the range than in the range.          The following histogram shows sales of milk (in litres) sold by Akiru.        What does the y-axis represent?    What does the x-axis represent?

  "body": " Probability 1   Introduction to Probability   is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where:    means the event is impossible.     means the event is certain.    A probability closer to indicates a higher likelihood of the event occurring.        Probability is widely used in everyday life, including:      - Meteorologists predict the likelihood of rain based on past data.     - Coaches analyze the probability of winning based on past performance.     - Doctors assess the probability of a patient responding to treatment.     - Insurance companies use probability to determine policy pricing.     - Dice rolling and card games use probability.     Probability is always between 0 and 1               - A process that leads to a specific result.     - A possible result of an experiment.     - A collection of one or more outcomes.     - The set of all possible outcomes.     - A measure of how likely an event is to occur.        Write down 3 events that could happen today (e.g., “It will rain” or “I will be late to school”)  Predict the probability of each event: ?    Probability Experiment and Sample Space  A probability experiment is an action or a process that results in a set of possible outcomes. The collection of all possible outcomes is called the sample space.      Here the material needed is only 1 coin  Toss a coin 20 times and record how many times it lands on heads and tails.  Discuss     Give the sample space    Compare your sample spaces        A student of Makhokho Secondary School rolled a six-sided die. Give the sample space    the possible outcomes are   the sample space consists of possible outcomes.      Mutuse's bag contains red ballgums, blue ballgums, and green ballgum.  If one ballgum is drawn at random, give the possible outcomes which is the probablity space       The sample space consists of three possible outcomes.       If a day of the week is randomly selected, what is the sample space for the chosen day?      A restaurant offers three choices of main course: chicken, fish, or vegetarian. What is the sample space for the main course a customer might order?      A traffic light can show green, yellow, or red. What is the sample space for the possible colors the traffic light can display?      A store sells t-shirts in sizes small, medium, and large. What is the sample space for the t-shirt sizes sold?      A person spins a spinner with sections labeled A, B, C, and D. What is the sample space for the outcome of the spin?       Probability of Simple Events  A simple event is an event that consists of only one outcome in the sample space.  The probability of a simple event is calculated using the formula   where;    is the probability of event     Favorable outcomes refer to the specific event we are interested in    Total outcomes refer to all possible outcomes in the sample space         Kanyamma rolls a fair six-sided die. What is the probability of Kanyama rolling a      Identify the Sample Space.    Identify the Favorable Outcomes    Apply the Probability Formula    Discuss and compare answers        A bag contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. If one ball is picked at random, what is the probability that it is red?    Total number of balls   Number of red balls   Given a bag with red balls and blue balls, the possible outcomes when picking one ball are     Total outcomes   Probability of drawing a red ball is given by:     the probability of picking a red ball is or       A teacher at Sironga Secondary school randomly selects a student from a class of 30 students. If there are 12 girls and 18 boys in the class, what is the probability that the selected student is a girl?       Sample Space is     The number of favorable outcomes that is choosing a girl =     Now, Applying our formula gives        The probability of selecting a girl is or        What is the probability of selecting the letter 'a' from the name \"Mukabwa\"?

A class has 25 students, and one student is chosen at random. What is the probability that a specific student is chosen?      What is the probability of selecting the letter \"e\" from the word \"elephant\"?       Mutually Exclusive and Independent Events   Mutually Exclusive  Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.  This means that if one event happens, the other cannot.      A traffic light being red and the same traffic light being green at the exact same time.    You are sleeping and you are wide awake at the exact same moment.    You are walking forward and you are walking backward at the exact same moment.    A glass being full and the same glass being empty at the same time.    A door being open and the same door being closed at the same time.     If and are mutually exclusive events, then;      The probability of either or occurring is;     Roll a fair six-sided die, what is the probability of rolling either a or a ?    Sample Space   Favorable Outcomes              Since rolling a 3 and rolling a 5 are mutually exclusive events;     the probability of rolling a or is or       A card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Let Event A be drawing a Heart and Event B be drawing a Spade. Are these events mutually exclusive? Explain     Find     Calculate     What is        Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time. Since a card cannot be both a Heart and a Spade, the events are mutually exclusive.     We calculate the probability of drawing a Heart or a Spade.  Since there are in the deck,     Since there are in the deck,       For mutually exclusive events, we use,                Since these events are mutually exclusive, their intersection is zero:             A student at khungu senior secondary school tosses a coin once. Are the events \"getting heads\" and \"getting tails\" mutually exclusive?      A person selects one piece of fruit from a bowl containing apples, bananas, and oranges.Is selecting an apple and selecting a banana mutually exclusive events?      A number is chosen between 1 and 10.   Are the events \"choosing an even number\" and \"choosing a prime number\" mutually exclusive?    Give the probability of choosing either an even number or a prime number.         A card is drawn from a standard 52-card deck.   Are the events \"drawing a diamond\" and \"drawing a club\" mutually exclusive?    What is the probability of drawing either a diamond or a club?         In a class, a student can receive a grade of A, B, C, D, or F.   Are the events \"getting an A\" and \"getting a F\" mutually exclusive?    What is the probability of either getting an A or getting an F?          Independent Events  Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other occurring.      A student choosing to study math and another student choosing to read a book in the library  These are typically independent choices.    A student bringing a lunch from home and another student buying a lunch from the cafeteria.    A student answering a question correctly in english class and another student dropping their pencil in science class.    A teacher calling on a student in math class and the bell ringing to signal the end of the period.        If and are independent events, then;   For events and      This means the probability of both events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities.    A coin is flipped, and a six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of getting heads and rolling a 6?       the Sample Space is  Possible coin outcomes   Possible die outcomes     Favorable Outcomes          Since flipping the coin and rolling the die are independent events              the probability of getting heads and a 6 is or       The probability of rain on a given day is , and the probability that a person is late to work is .     Find the probability that it rains    Find the probability that the person is late.    Find the probability that it rains and the person is late.    Find the probability that it does not rain but the person is late.    Find the probability that it rains or the person is late.          The probability that it rains is     The probability that it rains is .    The probability that the person is late is     The probability that the person is late is or .    Since rain and being late are independent,        The probability that it rains and the person is late is .    The probability that it does not rain is     Since rain and being late are independent        The probability that it does not rain but the person is late is or .    The probability that it rains or the person is late is           The probability that it rains or the person is late is or .          A coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting heads on both tosses?      A die is rolled, and a coin is tossed. What is the probability of rolling a 6 on the die and getting tails on the coin?      A bakery in Makongeni produces cakes. The probability that a cake is decorated with chocolate icing is . If two cakes are made independently, what is the probability that both cakes are decorated with chocolate icing?      A seed has a chance of germinating. If two seeds are planted independently, what is the probability that both seeds germinate?          Probability follows fundamental rules that help in calculating the likelihood of different events.    Addition Law of Probability   is used to find the probability of either one event or another occurring.     If two events cannot happen at the same time, they are mutually exclusive.  The probability of either event occurring is;        Since mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time,     A standard deck has cards, with hearts and clubs.  Since a single card cannot be both a heart and a club, the events are mutually exclusive.        =      =            the probability of drawing either a heart or a club is or           If two events can happen at the same time, we must subtract the probability of them happening together to avoid double counting.  The formula is;          A standard deck has   26 red cards    4 kings (2 of them are red)     now,               the probability of drawing either a red card or a king is or        A student can get an A, B, C, D, or F in a class. What is the probability that the student gets an A or a B?      A die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a 1 or a 6?      In a class of 30 students, 15 students like math, 10 students like chemistry, and 5 students like both math and chemistry. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student likes math or chemistry?      A bag contains 8 blue marbles and 5 yellow marbles. What is the probability of drawing a blue marble or a yellow marble?      In a class of 25 students, 12 play soccer, 10 play basketball, and 5 play both. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student plays soccer or basketball?      A bag contains letters of the word . What is the probability of selecting a vowel or the letter ?      A number is chosen between 1 and 10. What is the probability that it is a 3 or a 7?      A day of the week is chosen at random. What is the probability that it is a Saturday or a Sunday?       multiplication rule  The multiplication rule is used to find the probability of two events happening together.  For independent events (one event does not affect the other), the probability of both occurring is     This applies when the occurrence of one event does not change the probability of the other.  For Dependent Events     Here, is the probability that B happens given that A has already occurred.   A factory produces good items and defective items. A quality check is performed on two randomly selected items     Find the probability that both items are good.    Find the probability that at least one item is defective.    Are these events independent? Explain.        A student in Modegashe primary school was instructed to roll a Die and Toss a Coin.  What was the probability of rolling a 4 on the die and getting head on the coin?       Probability of rolling a 4 on a six-sided die is       Probability of getting heads on the coin is              the probability of rolling a 4 and flipping heads is or       A person has a probability of catching the first bus and an probability of catching the second bus (if they miss the first one)     Find the probability that the person catches the first bus.    Find the probability that the person misses the first bus but catches the second.    Find the probability that the person misses both buses.       Probability of catching the first bus:     Probability of missing the first bus     Probability of catching the second bus, given that the first bus was missed     Probability of missing the second bus, given that the first bus was missed        The probability of catching the first bus is directly given as     The probability of catching the first bus is or .    Missing the first bus   Catching the second bus   Since these events are dependent, we use the multiplication rule        The probability of missing the first bus but catching the second is or .    Missing the first bus   Missing the second bus   Again, using the multiplication rule        The probability of missing both buses is or .             A coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting heads on both tosses?      A die is rolled, and a coin is tossed. What is the probability of rolling a 6 and getting tails?

Assuming these forecasts are independent, what is the probability of sunshine on both Monday and Tuesday?      A farmer in Gakuonyo plants two seeds. Each seed has a 75% chance of germinating. What is the probability that both seeds germinate?        Tree Diagrams and Independent Events  A tree diagram is a visual representation of all possible outcomes of an event.  It helps in organizing complex probability problems, especially for events that happen in sequence.
