  "body": " Real Numbers  Real numbers are a set of numbers that include all rational and irrational numbers. It can be positive, negative, or zero, and can be represented on the number line. The table below shows classification of real numbers with examples.    Category  Examples    Whole numbers      Integers     Fractions     Decimals     Irrational numbers       Real numbers do not include complex numbers like the square root of .     We apply real numbers in our daily lives to manage money while budgeting or shopping for items, to measure ingredients when cooking, to track time and distance while traveling, and to understand data on digital devices.   Classifying whole numbers as odd, even, prime and composite in different situations  Whole numbers can be classified as odd, even, prime or composite based on their divisibility and factor properties.      are numbers that are divisible by .  To identify if a number is even, look at the digits in the ones place value if it or .   are numbers that when divided by two, you get a remainder.  To identify if a number is odd, look at the digit in the ones place value if it is or .        The sum or difference of two even numbers is even.  Example: and .    The sum or difference of two odd numbers is even.  Example: and     The sum of an even and an odd number is odd.  Example:     When two odd integers are multiplied, the result is always an odd number.  Example:     When two odd integers are divided, the result is always an odd number.  Example:     When two even integers are multiplied, the result is an even number.  Example:      An even number multiplied by an odd number equals an even number.  Example:        Classify the following numbers as even or odd:                                          is an odd number since its last digit is .     is an even number since its last digit is .     is an odd number since its last digit is .     is an even number since its last digit is .    For , we first solve for the expression.   therefore, which is even.   is even since multiplication of even numbers results to an even number.    Dividing by we get .  Since the result is then the number is an odd number.         Kirui has cows in his farm and wants to group them equally into pens. Will each pen have an equal number of cows? Explain using even and odd number properties.    First we identify if is even or odd.  Since the last digit is , then is an odd number.  An odd number cannot be divided evenly into equal groups.  Therefore, one group will have cows and the other cows, making it impossible to have equal number of cows in each pen.          Classify the following numbers as even or odd.                                                List all the numbers between and and identify odd and even number from the range.    Find the sum of the first numbers and determine if the result is odd or even.    A grade class has students and their class teacher wanted to group them in pairs. Will each group have an equal number of students? Explain using odd or even properties.    If a number is divisible by both and , what smallest composite number could it be?         is a number that has only two divisors, that is, and itself. Example:   To identify if a number is prime, check if the number has two factors: and itself.   are whole numbers that are greater than and has more than two factors.  Examples: . Hence and are composite numbers since they have more than factors.  To identify if a number is composite, check if the number has more than two factors.    and are neither prime nor composite.        The only even prime number is .    A composite number always has at least one prime factor e.g., .    All other even numbers except 2 are composite.            Working in groups, write numbers from to .    Sort the numbers you wrote down into odd or even.    What patterns do you notice between even and odd numbers?

The total number of students is . Prove whether this is prime or composite.       Classifying real numbers as rational and irrational in different situations    A rational number is any number that can be written as a fraction where and are integers and .  Example:     An irrational number is any number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two intergers.  Example:     consists of positive whole numbers, negative whole numbers and .   The decimal representation of a rational number either terminates (stops at some point) or repeats (continues forever but has a repeating pattern).  Example:    The decimal representation of an irrational number neither terminates (does not stop at any point) nor repeats (continues without following any pattern).  Example:    The square root of a perfect square is a rational number.  Example: and can be written as         Check if the number is an integer or a fraction with an integer as the numerator and the denominator. If it is, then it is a rational number.    If the number is in decimal form, check if the decimal stops at some point. If it stops then the number is a rational number.    If the number is in decimal form, check if the decimal continues. If it continues with a repeated pattern then the number is a rational number and if it continues without a pattern then it is irrational.    If the number is expressed as a square root i.e , find the square root of the number first and identify if it is a perfect or an imperfect square. If it is a perfect square (results to a whole number) then it is rational and if it is an imperfect square, then it is irrational.            Working in groups, write any numbers between and (e.g., )    Form at least fractions using the numbers you formed above. Form both proper and improper fractions e.g., .    Divide each of the fractions you formed to express it as a decimal. Example: .    Express the numbers as square roots. Example: .

Identify if the following numbers are rational or irrational.                                    Since is defined as .  We check if the decimal continues.  Hence is irrational because its decimal continues without having a repeated pattern.    Since is a fraction, we check if the fraction consist of integers with the denominator not equal to zero.  Therefore is a rational number.    To identify if is rational or irrational, we check if the decimal terminates or continues.  Since decimals in terminates, then it is a rational number.    For , first we find its value.      has decimal which continues without a repeated pattern.  Hence is irrational.    The value of    is a fraction with integers on the numerator and the denominator.  Therefore, is rational.         Joy is designing a square garden. She measures the total area of the garden to be square meters and wants to find the length of one side.

An (plural ) also called or is a way of writing repeated multiplication of the same number.   Why Are Indices Important?   Indices are widely used in:     Scientific notation writing, where numbers are sometimes very large and sometimes very small, such as the speed of light or the size of an atom.    Physics and Engineering to understand exponential growth and decay rates, such as radioactive decay and population growth.    Finance and money in calculating compound interest.       Expressing Numbers in Index Form   Introduction   Numbers can be written in different ways. One useful way is index notation (exponential form), which helps in simplifying calculations and representing very large or small numbers efficiently. In this section, you will learn how to express numbers using indices and understand their significance in mathematics.

A quadratic expression is an expression of the form: where;     and are constatnts (real numbers).     is avarible (what we look for or finding), and     beacuse if , it would not be a quadratic expression.     In the previous grades you learned about algebraic expressions  An expression of the form; is called a monomial expression   A monomial expression is a an expresssion with one term.  A binomial expression is an expression with two terms ie.    Expressions can be formed in various methods;   Multiplying a monmial witha binomial    multiplying two binomials.    Having a real life case.       Multiplying a Binomial with a Monomial.    Simplify:     Opening the brackets      Collecting like terms we form a quadratic expression:     From the example above you can see that;   are the monomial expressions while are the binomial expression.     Simplify the following expressions to form a quadratic expression.                                                                                                      Multipling Two Binomials.  Here we multiply (or expand) two liner hnomials       Find the product:      Grouping like terms together:     From the example we can see we formed an algrebaric expressions  The product of two identical binomials is known as the square of the binomial and is written as: If the two terms are of the form (ax + b) and (ax - b) then their product is: This product yields the difference of two squares.    Form a qudratic expression:      Expanding the brackets Collect like terms and form a quadratic expressions:       Form quadratic expression:                                                        real-life-situation      The length of a rectangle is meters more than its width. Form a quadratric expression using the following information.    First we have to identify the the values of the width and length, which are; and   The formula of finding the area of rectangle is;   Now lets form a quadratic expression using the values of lenght as; Substituting the values: Expanding the expression: The quadratic expression ofthe area is:       A farmer wants to create a rectangular garden with a fixed perimeter of 50 meters. The length of the garden is 10 meters more than the width. Form a quadratic expression to represent the area of the garden.

Write the quadratic expression for the area of the garden.        Quadratic Identities.  Quadratic identities can be used to simplify numerical expressions and solve equations efficiently.    Work Groups      From the previous lessons and exercises, not that;  and   In general, the quadratic identities are;              (Difference of two squares)     The three identites are useful in expansion and factorisation of many quadratic expressions.    Use the quadratic identities to write down the expansions of each of the following expressions:     To expand using the quadratic identity, we can apply the formula for squaring a binomial:   here and   Square the first term,   Multiply the first and second terms,   Square the second term,   Now putting all the terms together, we have;     So, the expected expansion of is;       Use the quadratic identities to write down the expansions of each of the following expressions:     To form a quadratic expression we just have to expand the expression;    Simplifying the expression, we have; Cancling out the like terms we;   So, the expected expansion of is;       Form a quadratic expression using the expansion method.     To form a quadratic expression using the expansion method, we multiply the two binomials:   Collecting like terms together we form;   Thus the expanded form of expression is;         Form a quadratic expression using the square of a binomial.     To form a quadratic expression using the square of a binomial, we square the binomial:   Expanding the binomial we get;   Collecting like terms together we form;   Thus the expanded form of expression is;         Use the quadratic identities to write down the expansions of each of the following expressions:                            Factorisation Of Quadratic Expressions.   Factorisation is the process of breaking down a quadratic expression into a product of simpler binomials.    Factorisation When The Coefficient Of Is One  The expression where are constants and , is called a quadratic expression.  In such expressions is called the coefficient of , is called the coefficient of and is called the constant term.  When the coefficient of is one, the expression is of the form   Cosider the following expressions:           Expanding the expressions we get:  Collecting like terms to get:      Expanding the expressions we get:  Simplify the middle terms:    From the above examples, we can see that the expressions and are formed from the factors of expressions and respectively.  The factorised form of the expression is where and are the factors of whose sum is .  In each case;   The sum of the constant terms in the factors is equal to the coefficient of in the expression.    The product of the constant terms in the factors is equal to the constant term in the expression.       Factorise the following expression:     In this case, the coefficient of is one, the coefficient of is 5 and the constant term is 6.  So the factors will be of the form where and are the factors of 6 whose sum is 5.  In the expression , look for two numbers such the numbers and such that is coefficient of and is the constant term.  In this case, the numbers are 2 and 3.     Grouping terms, we get:        Therefore, the factorised form of the expression is .      Factorise the following expression:     Look for two numbers such that the numbers and such that and .  The numbers are -4 and -5.  Then, the expression can be written as:   Grouping terms, we get:      The factorised form of the expression is .      Factorise the following expression:     Look for two numbers such that the numbers and such that and .  The numbers are 3 and 3.  Then, the expression can be written as:   Grouping terms, we get:      The factorised form of the expression is .      Factorise the following expressions:                                                                     Factorisation When The Coefficient Of Is Not One.  The general form of a quadratic expression is \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are constants.  In this section we are going to discuss how to factorise a quadratic expression when the in \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) is not equal to 1.  Consider the following identities:                                              From the above examples, we can see that the factorisation of a quadratic expression when the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is not one is similar to the factorisation of a quadratic expression when the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is one.  Factors are multiplied to get the final expresions on the righthand side (RHS) of the equations.   Given the quadratic expressions on the right-hand side of the equation, how can you factor them?   Consider the expression .  The problem can factorised as follows:     Look for two numbers such that:   Their product is equal to the product of the coefficient of and the constant term, i.e. .  In this case is the coefficient of and is constant term.    Their sum is , where is the coefficient of .  The terms are and        Rewrite the term as the sum of the two numbers found in step 1.  Thus,              Factorise the expression .    Multiply the coefficient of (which is 12) by the constant term (which is 6):   Find two numbers that multiply to give and add up to . The two numbers are and . and   Splt the middle term using these two numbers:   Factor by grouping:       Factorise the expression .      Factorise the expression .    The expression can be factorised as follows:   Look for two numbers such that:   Their product is equal to the product of the coefficient of and the constant term, i.e. .  In this case is the coefficient of and is constant term.    Their sum is , where is the coefficient of .  The terms are and        Rewrite the term as the sum of the two numbers found in step 1.  Thus,                Factorise the following expressions:                                                                                                                  Formation of Quadratic Equations by Factorisations.  Any equation of the form where are constants and is known as a quadratic equation. In this section, solutions of quadratic equations using the factor method is discussed.  To solve a quadratic equation by factorisation, we aim to rewrite the quadratic equation in the form of: where and are numbers that, when multiplied, give the product (the constant term), and when added, give the sum (the coefficient of the middle term).  To solve a quadratic eaquation, first ensure the equations is in the form; if not in the form rearrange, so that all terms are on one side of the equation and the equation equals zero.  Factor the quadratic expression:   Look for two numbers that when multiplied give (the coefficient of )    And, when added give (the coefficient of the middle term).   If the quadratic has a leading coefficient , you only need to find two numbers that multiply to and add to .    If , find two numbers that multiply to and add to .        Rewrite the middle term using these two numbers and factor by grouping, which you will have a quadratic of the form:      Solve     Factoring the left hand side (L.H.S) of the equation. The factors are .   Now create common factors Grouping them together we have:       Form a quadratic expression using the factoring method.     To form a quadratic expression using the factoring method, first set the expression equal to to form a quadratic equation:   Remove the common factor out and form a bracket:   Thus the factored form of expression is;          Form a quadratic expression using the following expressions.                                                                           Solutions Of Quadratic Equations By Factorisations.  In our previous sections we have discussed the form of a quadratic expression, identities and quadratic eaquations; how to form quadratic equations and differentiate between an expression and equation  In this section we are goin to learn about the solving the factored equation, we are going to continue from the point where we form factored equation  Numbers that satisfy an equation (its solutions) are called the roots of the equation.  Once you have factored the quadratic into the form; Set each factor equal to zero and solve for :             Solving these will give the two solutions for .    Solve     Look for two numbers that if multiplied by and when added up gives   These numbers are and So we can write the equation as: Finding a common factor we have: Grouping we have th factors of the equation as:   Setting each factor equal to zero (0).      or      Solving for       or     Thus, the solutions to the quadratic equation are;             We need 2 numbers to form factors, which when;   Multiplied to     Added up gives      These numbers are and So rewrite the middle part. Grouping the factors: Factor each group:   Set each factor eaqual to zero:      or      Solving for       or      Thus, the solutions to are:       Solve the quadratic equation by factorisation.                                  A car's speed is represented by a quadratic equation: . Find the possible values of x representing time.    The sum of a number and its square is . Form a quadratic equation and solve it to find the number.    Solve the quadratic equation:     A garden's area is 56 square meters, and its length is 4 meters more than its width. Form and solve a quadratic equation to find the dimensions of the garden.          Application Of Quadratic Equations To Real Life Situations.  Quadratic equations are a type of mathematical equation that can be used to describe many different real-life situations. Whether you're throwing a ball in the air, trying to maximize the area of a garden, or calculating profits for a business, quadratic equations can help solve problems that involve relationships with squared terms.  In this section, we will learn how to recognize real-life situations that can be modeled by quadratic equations, how to set them up, and how to solve them step by step.  A quadratic equation is an equation that can be written in the form: where,    , and are real numbers or constants,     is the unknown variable    and beacuse if is it would npt be a quadratic     Quadratic equations show up in many situations, especially when something is changing in a way that involves squares (like height, area, or profit).  Lets take a look at some of the situations Quadratic Equations is involved in real life situations.     One of the most common real-life situations for quadratic equations is projectile motion , such as when you throw a ball in the air. The height of the ball over time can be described by a quadratic equation.    A ball is thrown into the air from a height of meters with an initial upward velocity of meters per second. The height of the ball after seconds is given by: where is the height of the ball in meters and is the time in seconds. Find when the ball reaches the ground.    First we have to set the height equal to zero beacuse the ball reaches the ground when its height is zero.   Solve the equation using the quadratic formula;   For this equation,  and Now you need to subsitute these values into the formula:              From this you need to find the two possible solutions for time: (this is not a valid solution, since time can be negative)     The ball will hit the ground after approximately        Quadratic equations are also used in optimization problems. These are problems where you want to maximize or minimize something, like the area of a garden.    A farmer wants to build a rectangular fence with 120 meters of fencing. The length of the garden is 30 meters longer than the width. What should the dimensions of the garden be to maximize the area?           Businesses often use quadratic equations to model their profit. For example, the profit a company makes from selling a product can be modeled by a quadratic equation.    A company's profit from selling units of a product is given by the equation: Find how many units the company needs to sell to have no profit (i.e., when the profit is zero).          A stone is thrown into the air from a height of meters with an initial velocity of meters per second. The height of the stone at time is given by: Find when the stone reaches the ground.    A farmer has meters of fencing. He wants to build a rectangular garden. The length is meters longer than the width. What should the dimensions be to maximize the area?    A school's profit function is given by: Find the number of units the company must sell to achieve zero profit.    A water fountain shoots water into the air, and its height at any time (in seconds) is given by the equation: Find the time it will take for the water to return to the ground (i.e., when ).    Solve the following quadratic equation: Find the value of     A company finds that the revenue it generates from selling units of a product is given by the quadratic equation: Find the number of units that the company needs to sell to maximize its revenue.

Similarity  Similarity is a transformation that preserves the shape of a shape. The shape is similar to the original shape. The shape is similar to the original shape if the corresponding angles are equal and the corresponding sides are in proportion.           In figure below, the triangles and are similar.

We first identify the corresponding sides,  Side corresponds with side   Side corresponds with side   Side corresponds with side          In the triangles below, Determine which triangles are similar by comparing their corresponding sides:                                                              Given that triangle is similar to triangle , as shown in the diagram,      (a). Determine the measure of angle   (b). Calculate the value of     Find the value of x.        Given that is parallel to in the figure below, determine the measurements of line and .          Enlargement  Enlargement is a transformation that increases the size of a shape. The shape is enlarged by a scale factor. The scale factor is used to multiply the length of each side of the shape to get the length of the corresponding side of the enlarged shape.       In the figure 3.1, is a triangle in which  ,  and  . is a point such that  ,  and  .   Fig 3.1    Triangle has been obtained from triangle as follows:   , and are produced such that  ,  and  .  The process of obtaining triangle from triangle is known as   Triangle is said to be object and triangle , its image under enlargement.The point is known as the                    The scale factor of this enlargement is .In an enlargement, the object and its image remain similar. The linear scale factor of the enlargement determines the proportional transformation.    To determine the scale factor, divide the length of the enlarged image by the corresponding length of the original object.    In the figure below, Triangle is the enlarged image of triangle , with center   (a). Given that  and  , determine the scale factor of the enlargement.  (b). If  , find the length of                   Construct any triangle and choose a point outside the triangle. Using as the center of enlargement and a scale factor of , construct the enlarged image of triangle under the enlargement.          By measurement;    ,  and  .     Extend and measure  from to get .     Extend and measure  from to get .     Extend and measure  from to get .      Triangle is the image of triangle under an enlargement.Locate the centre of the enlargement.        To locate the centre of enlargement we follow the following steps:  Draw lines connecting point to , to and to and extend those lines. The intersection point of those lines, will be the center of enlargement.           Lines connecting object points to their corresponding image points intersect at the center of enlargement. This property helps in determining the center of enlargement when both the object and its image are given.    Given that , , , and are the verticies of the pentagon, find the verticies of its image after an enlargement with origin as the centre and scale factor of:  (a).   (b).   (c).       A triangle with the verticies , and is enlarged.If the centre of enlargment is , find the co-ordinates of the image of the triangle when the scale factor is:  (a).   (b).      Negative Scale Factor  In the provided diagram, rectangle has been enlarged to form rectangle , with point as the center of the enlargement.         If an enlargement has a negative scale factor, the image is formed on the opposite side of the center and is inverted (Upside down).  The rectangle has been enlarged by a scale factor of . .          Points , , and are the vertices of a triangle. Taking point as the centre of enlargement, find the coordinates of its image when the scale factor is .       Scale Factors     Scale factor is a fundamental concept in mathematics, especially in geometry, where it is used to describe the proportional relationship between similar figures.    It is defined as the ratio of corresponding side lengths in two similar shapes.    Understanding scale factor helps students grasp how objects are enlarged or reduced while maintaining their shape and proportions.      Area Scale Factor  Area scale factor is the ratio of the area of the image to area of the object.  In the Figures below, the parallelogram represents the enlarged image of paralellogram , transformed by a scale factor of .                  Area scale factor is the square of linear scale factor.    A square whose area is  is given an enlargement with a linear scale factor of .Find the area of the image.           Given that the ratio of the area of two circles is .  (a). Find the ratio of their radii  (b). If the smaller one has a radius of  , find the radius of the larger one.       (b).If the radius of the smaller circle is , then         Given that the following two figures below are similar, and the area of the first figure is , calculate the area of the second figure .      The corresponding sides of two similar regular hexagons are and respectively.  (a).Find the ratio of their areas.  (b).Calculate the area of the larger hexagon if the area of the smaller hexagon is .    The ratio of the area of two similar cones is .  (a).Find the area of the smaller cone if the area of the bigger cone is   (b). Find the ratio of their base radii.  (c). If the slanting height of the smaller cone is , find the slanting height of the larger cone.    The length of a parallelogram is and its area is . Calculate the length of a similar parallelogram whose area is .    The area of a circle is . A second circle has a radius that is times the radius of the first circle. What is the area of the second circle?      Volume Scale Factor          The corresponding heights of two similar cylinders are and .  (a). Find the ratio of their corresponding volumes.  (b).If the smaller cylinder has a volume of , find the volume of the larger cylinder.           The capacity of two similar containers are and .Find the ratio of their:  (a). Heights  (b). If the area of the smaller container is , find the area of the larger container.              Given that shape A and shape B are similar solids, and the volume of A is 400 cm³, calculate the volume of B.                Two similar containers have heights of and , respectively. If the smaller container holds , what is the capacity of the larger container?    Two similar cans have volumes of and respectively. If the smaller can has a height of , what is the height of the larger can?    The ratio of the lengths of the corresponding sides of two similar rectangular tanks is .The volume of the smaller tank is .Calculate the volume of the larger tank.    A small cube has a length of . A larger cube is created by scaling the small cube, such that each side of the larger cube is times the length of the corresponding side of the small cube.  (a).What is the volume of the small cube?  (b).What is the volume of the larger cube?  (c). By what factor has the volume increased when the small cube is scaled to the larger cube?       Application of Similarity and Enlargement  Similarity and enlargement are used in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, in geometry, similarity and enlargement are used to find the dimensions of similar shapes. In physics, similarity and enlargement are used to find the dimensions of objects that are too small or too large to measure directly. In biology, similarity and enlargement are used to study the growth of plants and animals. In chemistry, similarity and enlargement are used to study the structure of molecules. In computer science, similarity and enlargement are used to create computer graphics.   "

  "body": " Trigonometry 1    In Grade 10 Trigonometry 1, we will learn about trigonometric ratios—sine, cosine, and tangent and use them to solve problems involving right-angled triangles. we will apply the Pythagorean theorem and use special angle values to find unknown sides or angles in a triangle. These concepts will help in real-world applications, such as measuring the height of a building and many more.      Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. It is primarily concerned with right-angled triangles and uses trigonometric functions such as (sine), (cosine), and (tangent) to describe these relationships.  Right-angled triangles can be found in various real-life structures and objects. Some examples include:  Staircases: A staircase forms a right-angled triangle with the vertical wall (height), the horizontal floor (base), and the slanted stairs (hypotenuse).  Roof Structures: The triangular sections of a gable roof create right-angled triangles where the vertical rise meets the base of the roof.  Ladders Against a Wall: A ladder leaning against a wall forms a right-angled triangle with the ground and the wall.  Bridges and Ramps: Ramps for wheelchairs or inclined roads often create right-angled triangles.  Tree Shadows: The height of a tree, its shadow, and the line from the top of the tree to the tip of the shadow form a right-angled triangle.      Trigonometric ratios of acute angles   An acute angle is an angle that measures greater than 0° but less than 90° . In other words, it is an angle that is smaller than a right angle (90°).   Examples of Acute Angles     30°, 45°, and 60° are common acute angles in trigonometry.  Any angle between 0° and 90° is considered acute.     Characteristics of Acute Angles     They are always found in right-angled triangles.  The sum of two acute angles in a right-angled triangle is always 90° because the third angle is the right angle (90°).  They appear in various geometric shapes like triangles, polygons, and real-world structures.      Tangent of an Acute Angle  Recal:  The inclination of the observer's line of sight to the top of a high flagpole, positioned away, can be determined using a scale drawing, as illustrated in fig 1.1 In the diagram, the inclination (angle of elevation) is represented by the angle x.   Fig 1.1           What you require: A piece of paper, a ruler and a pencil.     Using a piece of paper,a rular and a pencil, Draw the diagram like the one shown below.   fig 1.2       Measure the length .   Show whether the triangle .

For the parallel lines of that is and , What do you notice about the ratio of vertical distance and the horizontal distance?   Measure the angle represented by   Discuss your findings with other learners in your class.       Essential Concept:   You will notice that when given the triangle below,   fig 1.3         Triangle are similar.  This implies that the ratios of sides that is     For any line parallel to , ratio of will be the same in each triangle above that is   This constant ratio, is called the .  Therefore, tangent of which can be written as .  The tangent of an angle depends on the size of the angle only     The figure below shows a right-angled triangle , in which .   fig 1.4      The vertical side is opposite angle . The horizontal side is adjacent to angle .  In this sinario, .   Further activity   Express in terms of the lengths of the sides of the triangle Shown above in fig 1.4    Determine the opposite and adjacent sides corresponding to each of the labeled acute angles in the given right-angled triangles below.               The opposite side   The adjacent side     The opposite side   The adjacent side          Find the tangents of the indicated angles using the given measurements below.       The above diagram the sides given are,  Opposite side   Adjacent side   Therefore,     Therefore,       Find the tangent in the indicated angle below.       The first thing you should do is to calculate the perpendicular height of the Triangle then identify the opposite and the adjacent sides of angle and angle . Finaly find there tangents  Finding the perpendicular height.  We use pythagorean relationship that is      Finding      The opposite side   The adjacent side      Finding      The opposite side   The adjacent side      Therefore,          The Table of Tangents is a mathematical reference table that provides values of the tangent function ( ) for various angles, typically in degrees or radians. It helps in solving trigonometry problems when a calculator is not available. Here's how you can use it:  Special tables have been prepared and can be used to obtain tangents of acute angle (see tables of natural tangents in your mathematical tables). The technique of reading tables of tangents is similar to that of reading tables of logarithms or square roots.  Here's how you can use it:     Identify the Angle     Find the given angle in the leftmost column (if degrees) or the top row (if radians).       Locate the Tangent Value     Read across the row (or down the column) to find the corresponding tangent value.         Note      In the tables of tangents, the angles are expressed in decimals and degrees or in degrees and minutes.    One degree is equal to . Thus, .     From the table, the values of tangents increase as the angles approach        What you require: Printed Table of Tangent, a ruler, pencil, and calculator (for verification).     What is the tangent of an angle?    How do we use a Table of Tangents?    Use your Table of Tangent to find the folowing tangents.                            Discuss your findings with other groups in your class.        Find the tangent of each of the following angles from the table:                               Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Locate in the table.  Read the corresponding tangent value. that is     Find   Convert to degrees by deviding by      Therefore,   Using decimal tables, . From the difference column under reads   Therefore,          Use Natural logarithm of tangents to find the length in the figure below.       Th sides given are,  Adjacent   Opposite      By the formular .  Therefore,   This implies that,   Find using the tangent table, we have that,     Therefore,       Using natural tangents in your mathematical tables, find as shown in the figure below.       Opposite   Adjacent      Note that cannot be read directly from the tables of tangents. Therefore, look for a number nearest to from the tables. In this case, the nearest number is The angle whose tangent is is   The difference between and is . From the difference column in the tangent tables, the nearest number to is which gives a difference of .  Adding to we get .  Therefore, the angle whose tangent is    Thus, .          Read from tables the tangent of:                       Express each of the following in degrees and minutes:                       A ladder leans against a wall so that its foot is away from the foot of the wall and its top is up the wall. Calculate the angle it makes with the ground.    In a right-angled triangle, the shorter sides are and long. Find the sizes of its acute angles.

Fill also the following;      ____     ____     ____       What do you notice about these ratios (5) above.    Discuss your findings with other groups in your class.       Essential Concept:   You will notice that,     The ratios of (3) are the same that is,     This constant value is obtained by taking the ratio of the side opposite to the angle to the hypotenuse side in each case. This ratio is called the sine of angle ,Which can be whritten as as .    The ratios of (5) are the same that is,     This constant value is obtained by taking the ratio of the side adjacent to the angle to the hypotenuse side in each case. This ratio is called the cosine of angle ,Which can be whritten as as .

  "body": "   Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. It is primarily concerned with right-angled triangles and uses trigonometric functions such as (sine), (cosine), and (tangent) to describe these relationships.  Right-angled triangles can be found in various real-life structures and objects. Some examples include:  Staircases: A staircase forms a right-angled triangle with the vertical wall (height), the horizontal floor (base), and the slanted stairs (hypotenuse).  Roof Structures: The triangular sections of a gable roof create right-angled triangles where the vertical rise meets the base of the roof.  Ladders Against a Wall: A ladder leaning against a wall forms a right-angled triangle with the ground and the wall.  Bridges and Ramps: Ramps for wheelchairs or inclined roads often create right-angled triangles.  Tree Shadows: The height of a tree, its shadow, and the line from the top of the tree to the tip of the shadow form a right-angled triangle.   "

Displacement Time Graph of Different Situations   is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of an object, represented as a vector.  When distance is plotted against time, a distance-time graph is obtained.      A motorist travels from Limuru to Kisumu. The table below shows the distances covered at different times:                            Graph the data and use it to answer   How far was the motorist from Limuru at 10:30 AM?

Draw the displacement-time graph and determine the displacement at .    Since the velocity is constant, the displacement increases linearly with time  Hence ,   at               A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at for seconds.  Draw the displacement-time graph.    Since acceleration is constant, the displacement follows the equation     for different time values:    Time (s)  Displacement (m)                        Here is the graph         A car moves in three different phases as shown below;  The car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly.

Determine the displacement at         - The displacement follows a curved path because the car is accelerating.   - The displacement increases linearly since the velocity is constant.   - The displacement remains constant because the car has stopped.         A car moves along a straight road, and its displacement from the starting point is recorded at different times.  The data is shown below;                                               Plot a displacement-time graph using the data above    Describe the motion of the car based on the graph.

Interpretation of displacement time graph  The interpretation of the graph depends on its shape and slope:     Slope of the Graph (Gradient) = Velocity     A steeper slope means higher velocity.    A positive slope (upward line) indicates motion in the positive direction.    A negative slope (downward line) means motion in the negative direction.    A zero slope (horizontal line) means the object is at rest (no change in displacement).       Shape of the Graph     Straight Line: Uniform (constant) velocity.    A curved line indicates that the object's velocity is changing, meaning it's accelerating or decelerating.    Flat Line: No movement (object is stationary).       Interpreting Different Sections     A horizontal straight line means the object is stationary (velocity is zero).    A steeper line means the object is moving faster.         Work in groups     Consider the displacement time graph representing distance covered by a motorist traveling from Turkana to Nairobi.       How far was the motorist from the starting point at ?    What was the total distance covered by the motorist?    During which periods was the motorist stationary?    Calculate the average speed of the motorist between and .    What was the overall average speed for the entire journey?        Use the displacement-time graph for constant velocity to answer the following questions.        What type of motion does the graph represent? Explain your answer.    What is the displacement of the car at = seconds?    What is the total displacement at = seconds    Determine the velocity of the car from the graph.          The graph shows a straight line with a constant slope, indicating uniform motion. This means the car is moving at a constant velocity with no acceleration.    From the graph, the displacement at = seconds is meters.    Using the equation of motion:     Therefore, = seconds, the car’s displacement is meters.    Velocity is given by the slope of the displacement-time graph:     This confirms the car’s velocity is  .         Use the graph below to answer the questions.        What type of motion is represented by the graph? Explain your reasoning.    If the train continued to accelerate at  , what would be its approximate displacement at = seconds?    What is the displacement of the body at t = 7 seconds?          The graph represents uniformly accelerated motion.  The line on the graph is curved, not straight. This means the object is not moving the same distance each second. Its speed is changing.    Using the equation:     The approximate displacement at = seconds would be meters.              The displacement-time graph below shows a train moving at a constant velocity.     Use th graph to answer the following questions.     What is the displacement at = ?    If the object continued moving for seconds, what would be its total displacement?    What would the graph look like if the object stopped moving after seconds?

At what time did the motorist stop for a break?    Calculate the speed of the motorist between  and  .    What was the speed of the motorist from  and  ?    Find the overall average speed of the entire journey.    Identify a section of the graph where the motorist was stationary.    Describe what happens when the graph has a steeper slope.         Velocity time graph  A velocity-time graph is a graph that shows how an object's velocity (speed with direction) changes over time.        X-Axis (Horizontal Axis): Represents time (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours).    Y-Axis (Vertical Axis): Represents velocity (e.g., m\/s, km\/h).    Slope of the Graph: Represents acceleration (how fast velocity is changing).    Area Under the Graph: Represents displacement (total distance covered).           Horizontal Line:     The object is moving at a constant velocity (zero acceleration).       Upward Sloping Line:     The object is accelerating (velocity is increasing).       Downward Sloping Line:     The object is decelerating (velocity is decreasing).       Line at Zero Velocity:     The object not moving.         Work in groups     A train moving at along a North-South railway track passes through a station R at . The train is decelerating at northward.  Find the velocity of the train:      after      after      after        Determine the average velocity of the train:     In the first after     In the first after        Draw a velocity-time graph, find the distance of the train from R at 12 seconds past 5:30 PM.

It then maintains this velocity for before decelerating to rest, with the total time of motion being      Draw the velocity-time graph to represent its motion.    Find the total distance covered.    Determine the average velocity.    Calculate the acceleration and deceleration.         given the table below      Time            Velocity (m\/s)               Draw the velocity time graph to represent the data    Use the graph describe the motion of the vehicle. Is the velocity constant, increasing, or decreasing? Justify your answer.    Calculate the average velocity of the vehicle between = and =           Relative Speed    Relative speed is a simple concept that helps us understand how fast one object is moving compared to another object. It's important because sometimes objects are moving at different speeds, and we need to figure out how quickly they are closing the gap between them or moving away from each other.  Consider a case where two bodies moving in the same direction at different speeds. Their is the difference between the individual speeds.  But if they are moving toward each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.    When Objects Move in the Same Direction   Work in Groups.  In this activity you are required to work and groups and follow each step as listed.   Requirements:    Toy car (that can be pulled by a string).    String (long enough for the car to travel a sufficient distance).    Stopwatch or timer    Measuring tape or marked distance on the ground (e.g., 10 meters)    Pen and paper (for recording results)    Observers (to track the race and help evaluate results)    Calculator (optional, for calculations)    Steps:    Find a straight line or pathway that is clear and suitable for the race (a hallway, classroom floor, long corridor or outside on a field).    Measure out a distance for the race, such as 10 meters. You can use a measuring tape or use a marked area to set the starting and finishing points.    Mark the starting line and the finish line clearly, so both the toy car and the student know where to start and end.    Attach one end of the string securely to the toy car. The other end of the string should be held by a participant or fixed to an anchor (like a pole or sturdy object) so that when the student pulls the string, the car moves along the line and test the toy car to ensure that it moves easily along the straight path when the string is pulled.    You will have two participants: one student (who will walk) and one toy car (which will be pulled by the string).    Assign at least one observer to track the race. The observer(s) will help measure the time it takes for each participant (the student and the toy car) to reach the finish line.    Place the student and the toy at the starting line. The student should be ready to walk at a constant speed.    On the count of \"Go!\", the student starts walking in a straight line towards the finish line. At the same time, the person holding the string should start pulling the toy car in the same direction (straight line) at a constant speed. The toy car should be pulled in a way that resembles a consistent movement, not too fast or too slow.    The observers should start the stopwatch as soon as both participants begin moving and stop it when either the student or the toy car reaches the finish line.    Record the time taken by both the student and the toy car to reach the finish line. If you have more than one observer, make sure they agree on the recorded times.    After the race, you need to calculate the relative speed between the student and the toy car.   Let's say the student took seconds to cover the distance ( meters), and the toy took seconds to cover same distance    The speed of the student is: The speed of the toy car is:     If the student and the toy car are moving in the same direction, the relative speed can be given as:        Compare and share your fndings with other groups of both the student and the toy car.    Discuss;   Who moved faster? Was the student walking faster or slower than the toy car?    Why one object might have moved faster than the other. Did the toy car move faster because it was pulled, or was the student faster in their walking?    The relative speed: How does the speed of each participant relate to the other? Did they move away from each other, or did they move closer together?       Now try the activity in different conditions or compare vraious speed by repeating the race multiple times.   Have the student walk faster or slower.    Change the length of the race to see how it affects the results.    Adjust how fast the toy car is pulled.

String (long enough for the car to travel a sufficient distance).    Stopwatch or timer    Measuring tape or marked distance on the ground (e.g., 10 meters)    Pen and paper (for recording results)    Observers (to track the race and help evaluate results)    Calculator (optional, for calculations)    Steps:    Find a straight line or pathway that is clear and suitable for the race (a hallway, classroom floor, long corridor or outside on a field).    Measure out a distance for the race, such as 10 meters. You can use a measuring tape or use a marked area to set the starting and finishing points.    Mark the starting line and the finish line clearly, so both the toy car and the student know where to start and end.    Attach one end of the string securely to the toy car. The other end of the string should be held by a participant or fixed to an anchor (like a pole or sturdy object) so that when the student pulls the string, the car moves along the line and test the toy car to ensure that it moves easily along the straight path when the string is pulled.    You will have two participants: one student (who will walk) and one toy car (which will be pulled by the string).    Assign at least one observer to track the race. The observer(s) will help measure the time it takes for each participant (the student and the toy car) to reach the finish line.    Place the student and the toy at the starting line. The student should be ready to walk at a constant speed.    On the count of \"Go!\", the student starts walking in a straight line towards the finish line. At the same time, the person holding the string should start pulling the toy car in the same direction (straight line) at a constant speed. The toy car should be pulled in a way that resembles a consistent movement, not too fast or too slow.    The observers should start the stopwatch as soon as both participants begin moving and stop it when either the student or the toy car reaches the finish line.    Record the time taken by both the student and the toy car to reach the finish line. If you have more than one observer, make sure they agree on the recorded times.    After the race, you need to calculate the relative speed between the student and the toy car.   Let's say the student took seconds to cover the distance ( meters), and the toy took seconds to cover same distance    The speed of the student is: The speed of the toy car is:     If the student and the toy car are moving in the same direction, the relative speed can be given as:        Compare and share your fndings with other groups of both the student and the toy car.    Discuss;   Who moved faster? Was the student walking faster or slower than the toy car?    Why one object might have moved faster than the other. Did the toy car move faster because it was pulled, or was the student faster in their walking?    The relative speed: How does the speed of each participant relate to the other? Did they move away from each other, or did they move closer together?       Now try the activity in different conditions or compare vraious speed by repeating the race multiple times.   Have the student walk faster or slower.    Change the length of the race to see how it affects the results.    Adjust how fast the toy car is pulled.        "

Data collection is the process of gathering information for analysis, interpretation, and decision-making.  Data can be obtained from two main sources:    Sources of data  Data can be obtained from two main sources:        These are first-hand data collected directly by an individual or organization for a specific purpose.  For examples:    Conducting surveys  Interviews with individuals or groups  Experiments and observations  Group discussions         These are data that have already been collected and recorded by others for a different purpose.  For examples:    Government reports (e.g., census data)  Research articles and journals  Newspapers and magazines  Online databases and records         These are sources that compile and summarize information from primary and secondary sources.  For examples:    Dictionaries  Textbooks  Encyclopedias (e.g., Wikipedia)        Work in groups     Form groups of 3-5 students.    Collect data from both primary and secondary sources based on the topic.     The Most Popular Mode of Transport in Our Community.       Primary Data Collection:     Conduct a short survey by asking at least 10 people what mode of transport they use most often (e.g., walking, bicycles, motorcycles, public buses, private cars).    Record their responses in a table.       Secondary Data Collection:     Find information from newspapers, government reports, or websites about transport statistics in Kenya.       Compare the findings from both sources.    Present your results in a short report or class discussion.        Classify the Following as Primary or Secondary Data Sources:    A student conducts a survey to find out the favorite sports of their classmates.  A teacher uses last year’s national exam results to analyze student performance trends.  A researcher reads a government report on the most common diseases in Kenya.  A doctor observes a patient’s symptoms and records them for a medical study.  A scientist conducts an experiment to test the growth rate of plants under different conditions.        Primary because the student is collecting firsthand data directly from people.  Secondary because the exam results were already collected and recorded by an external body.  Secondary because The report was collected and published by someone else for a different purpose.  Primary because The doctor is directly collecting new data from real-life observation.  Primary because The scientist is generating new data through an experiment.        A community group wants to understand the needs of youth in their area.

Representing data using a frequency distribution table  A frequency distribution table is a table that organizes data into categories or groups, showing how often each category or range of values appears in a dataset.  There are two types:     Ungrouped Frequency Distribution: for small datasets with individual values.    Grouped Frequency Distribution: for large datasets where values are grouped into intervals.     Frequency refers to the number of times a specific value or range of values appears in a dataset.   Work in groups     Below are the weekly pocket expenses (in Ksh) of a randomly selected group of 25 students.          Prepare a frequency distribution table for the grouped data.    Identify the number with the highest frequency.    Compare your answer with others in class.      Learning point     A tally mark represents a single count, with each mark representing one occurrence.    A frequency table is a table that shows an event and how many times it happens.

Measures of central tendency  Measures of central tendency are statistical values that represent the middle or most frequently occurring number in a dataset.  There are three main measures of central tendency:     Mean  Mean is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values. It is also known as Arithmetic Average.     Where represents the values in the dataset and is the total number of values.    Median  Median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.    Mode  Mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. A dataset can have:    No mode: if no value repeats.  One mode (Unimodal): if one value appears most frequently.  Two modes (Bimodal): if two values appear equally most frequently.  Multimodal: if more than two values appear frequently.        Work in groups     Consider the following data set:       State whether this data is ungrouped or grouped.    Find the Mean, Mode and Median for the data.    Discuss with other groups      Learning point     Measures of central tendency (Mean, Median, and Mode) help summarize a dataset by identifying its central value, with Mean used for numerical averages, Median for middle values in ordered data, and Mode for the most frequently occurring value.       In a class of students, the test scores of students are:      Find the:     Mean    Median    Mode          The formula for the mean is:     Where;      is the sum of all values     is the total number of values      =         =   Therefore, the mean is     Median  The median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.        Since there are 30 values (even number), the median is;   =       =    =      Therefore the median is     Mode  The mode is the most frequently occurring values.  From the sorted data:      appears times     appears times     Since and appear most frequently, this dataset is bimodal with modes: and .         A company records the monthly salaries (in KES) of employees as follows:                    Find the modal class of the data.       Since the dataset is large, we need to determine appropriate class intervals to identify the modal class in the grouped data.      Salary Range (KES)  Frequency (Number of Employees)                                         The modal class is , since is the one with the highest frequency.      The points scored by a basketball team of Turkana Girls' National School in a series of matches are:     Find the median of the points scored by the team.    The number of books borrowed by students from a school library in a week is as follows:        Find the Mean (Average) number of books borrowed.    Find the Median number of books borrowed.    Find the Mode of the books borrowed.       Fifteen students in a class measured their height in cm as follows:        Make a frequency distribution table for the set of data.    Determine the mode and Median.       The price of 1 liter of petrol (in KSH) at different petrol stations in a town for a year is recorded as follows:   Table showing the price of petrol (in KSH) for each month in a year:    Month  Jan  Feb  March  April  May  June  July  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec    Price(Ksh.)                 Calculate the median for the price of petrol.    The following dataset shows the monthly electricity bills (in KSH) paid by households in a town.           Convert the datasets into grouped data by creating class intervals.    Find the Mean, Median, and Mode for the dataset.    Identify the Modal Class for a grouped version of the dataset.       In a market, 40 vendors recorded their daily sales (in KSH), which are organized in the table below.      Daily Sales Range (KSH)  Number of Vendors (Frequency)                                    Find the Mean (Average) daily sales.    Determine the Median class interval.    Identify the Modal class (the class with the highest frequency).         Representation of data   Representation of data refers to the various ways in which collected information can be organized, visualized, and interpreted.  Under representation of data we have graphical representation which Uses charts and graphs to visualize data i.e. Histogram and Frequency Polygon.    Drawing Histograms and Frequency polygons of data  Histograms and Frequency Polygons are graphical methods used to represent continuous data. They help in understanding the distribution and patterns of data.     Histogram     A histogram is a graphical representation of grouped data using bars.    Similar to a bar graph, but the bars touch each other because the data is continuous.    Used for continuous numerical data.    The height of each bar represents the frequency (number of occurrences) of data within that range.       Frequency Polygon.     A frequency polygon is a line graph used to represent frequency distributions.    It is created by plotting points at the midpoint of each histogram bar and connecting them with straight lines.    It helps visualize trends in data and compare distributions.         Work in groups     In a school with students, their heights were measured and recorded in the following table.      Height (cm)  Number of Students (Frequency)                               Choose a suitable scale and represent the data on a histogram and a frequency polygon.    Compare and discuss your graphs with other groups.      Learning point     A histogram represents data using adjacent bars to show frequency distribution, while a frequency polygon connects midpoints of class intervals with a line to display trends and comparisons.       A fruit vendor records the number of fruits sold in a day, categorized by quantity. The data is presented in the table below:      Number of Fruits Sold  Frequency (Days)  Midpoint                                   Using appropriate scale, draw a histogram to represent the data.             A logistics company recorded the distances covered by their delivery vehicles over a certain period. The distances are grouped into intervals as follows:      Distance Range (km)  Frequency (Number of Vehicles)                         Use a suitable scale, draw a frequency polygon to represent the data.    First, find the midpoints and record in the table.         Distance Range (km)  Frequency (Number of Vehicles)  Midpoint                                     The following data represents the heights (in cm) of students in a class:           Create a frequency table with class intervals of and midpoints of the data.    Using the frequency table you created Draw a histogram to represent the data.    Draw a frequency polygon on the same axes as your histogram.    Label your axes and give your graphs appropriate titles.       The following data represents the ages of people in a community meeting:           Create a frequency table with class intervals of years    Draw a histogram to represent the data.    Draw a frequency polygon on the same axes.    Label the axes and provide titles for your graphs.       A school collected data on the number of books read by students in a term. The following frequency table shows the results:      Number of Books Read  Frequency                            Draw a histogram to represent the data from your frequency table.    On the same axes, draw a frequency polygon.    Estimate the median number of books read. Explain your reasoning.       A survey was conducted to find out how much time people spend on social media daily. The following data was collected:      Time (Minutes)  Frequency  Class Width  Frequency Density                                      Draw a histogram to represent the sales data.    Draw a frequency polygon to represent the sales data.    Label your axes and provide appropriate titles for your graphs.       A local community group recorded the daily rainfall (in millimeters) for the month of April. The data is as follows:        Draw a histogram to represent the rainfall data.       Interpretation of data   Interpretation of data is the process of analyzing, organizing, and making sense of collected information to extract meaningful insights. It involves identifying patterns, relationships, and trends to support decision-making and problem-solving.    Interpreting histograms and frequency polygons     Work in groups  The histogram below represent a household's daily water consumption (in liters) recorded over a month.        Determine the day when the water consumption was high.    Determine the day when the water consumption was low.    Discuss and share with other group.        Use the histogram shown below to answer the questions that follows:        Which speed range (class interval) had the highest frequency of vehicles?    Describe the shape of the histogram. Is it symmetrical, skewed.    What does the y-axis represent?    What is the lowest frequency recorded, and for which speed range does it occur?    If the speed limit is 80 km\/h, how many vehicles exceeded this limit based on the histogram?    Based on the histogram, what conclusions can you draw about vehicle speeds on this highway?          The speed range with the highest frequency is 90 km\/h.    The histogram is skewed right (positively skewed). The tail extends further to the right (higher speeds).    The y-axis represents the frequency, which is the number of vehicles recorded in each speed category.    The lowest frequency recorded is 1, and it occurs for the speed range 100 km\/h.    To find this, we need to add the frequencies of all the bars to the right of 80 km\/h.  The frequencies are:     80-89 km\/h: 6    90-99 km\/h: 7    100 km\/h: 1     Total vehicles exceeding 80 km\/h: = vehicles.       Most Common Speed: The most common speed range is around 90 km\/h.    Right Skew: There's a tendency for vehicles to travel at higher speeds, as indicated by the right skew.    Speed Limit Violations: A significant number of vehicles are exceeding the 80 km\/h speed limit.    Lower Speeds: There is a very low frequency of cars travelling at lower speeds. (Below 60km\/h)            The histogram below represents the ages of attendees recorded by the organizers at a community event.        How many age groups are represented in the histogram?    What is the total number of attendees recorded in the histogram?    Which age group has the highest number of attendees?          By counting the number of bars in the histogram, we can determine the number of age groups.  The bars are   Therefore, there were five age groups that attended the event.    The total number of attendees is the sum of all frequencies (heights of the bars).   =   Therefore, the number of attendees were     The age group corresponding to the tallest bar has the highest number of attendees.  Therefore, the age group had the highest number of attendees, with a total of participants.         The following histogram shows sales of milk (in litres) sold by Akiru.

  "body": " Probability 1   Introduction to Probability   is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where:    means the event is impossible.     means the event is certain.    A probability closer to indicates a higher likelihood of the event occurring.        Probability is widely used in everyday life, including:      - Meteorologists predict the likelihood of rain based on past data.     - Coaches analyze the probability of winning based on past performance.     - Doctors assess the probability of a patient responding to treatment.     - Insurance companies use probability to determine policy pricing.     - Dice rolling and card games use probability.     Probability is always between 0 and 1          Probability Experiment and Sample Space  A probability experiment is an action or a process that results in a set of possible outcomes. The collection of all possible outcomes is called the sample space.      Here the material needed is only 1 coin  Toss a coin 20 times and record how many times it lands on heads and tails.  Discuss     Give the sample space    Compare your sample spaces        A student of Makhokho Secondary School rolled a six-sided die. Give the sample space    the possible outcomes are   the sample space consists of possible outcomes.      Mutuse's bag contains red ballgums, blue ballgums, and green ballgum.  If one ballgum is drawn at random, give the possible outcomes which is the probablity space       The sample space consists of three possible outcomes.      If a day of the week is randomly selected, what is the sample space for the chosen day?    A restaurant offers three choices of main course: chicken, fish, or vegetarian. What is the sample space for the main course a customer might order?    A traffic light can show green, yellow, or red. What is the sample space for the possible colors the traffic light can display?    A store sells t-shirts in sizes small, medium, and large. What is the sample space for the t-shirt sizes sold?    A person spins a spinner with sections labeled A, B, C, and D. What is the sample space for the outcome of the spin?      Probability of Simple Events  A simple event is an event that consists of only one outcome in the sample space.  The probability of a simple event is calculated using the formula   where;    is the probability of event     Favorable outcomes refer to the specific event we are interested in    Total outcomes refer to all possible outcomes in the sample space         Kanyamma rolls a fair six-sided die.

What is the probability of selecting the letter \"e\" from the word \"elephant\"?      Mutually Exclusive and Independent Events   Mutually Exclusive  Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.  This means that if one event happens, the other cannot.      A traffic light being red and the same traffic light being green at the exact same time.    You are sleeping and you are wide awake at the exact same moment.    You are walking forward and you are walking backward at the exact same moment.    A glass being full and the same glass being empty at the same time.    A door being open and the same door being closed at the same time.     If and are mutually exclusive events, then;      The probability of either or occurring is;     Roll a fair six-sided die, what is the probability of rolling either a or a ?    Sample Space   Favorable Outcomes              Since rolling a 3 and rolling a 5 are mutually exclusive events;     the probability of rolling a or is or       A card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Let Event A be drawing a Heart and Event B be drawing a Spade. Are these events mutually exclusive? Explain     Find     Calculate     What is        Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time. Since a card cannot be both a Heart and a Spade, the events are mutually exclusive.     We calculate the probability of drawing a Heart or a Spade.  Since there are in the deck,     Since there are in the deck,       For mutually exclusive events, we use,                Since these events are mutually exclusive, their intersection is zero:            A student at khungu senior secondary school tosses a coin once. Are the events \"getting heads\" and \"getting tails\" mutually exclusive?    A person selects one piece of fruit from a bowl containing apples, bananas, and oranges.Is selecting an apple and selecting a banana mutually exclusive events?    A number is chosen between 1 and 10.   Are the events \"choosing an even number\" and \"choosing a prime number\" mutually exclusive?    Give the probability of choosing either an even number or a prime number.       A card is drawn from a standard 52-card deck.   Are the events \"drawing a diamond\" and \"drawing a club\" mutually exclusive?    What is the probability of drawing either a diamond or a club?       In a class, a student can receive a grade of A, B, C, D, or F.   Are the events \"getting an A\" and \"getting a F\" mutually exclusive?    What is the probability of either getting an A or getting an F?         Independent Events  Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other occurring.      A student choosing to study math and another student choosing to read a book in the library  These are typically independent choices.    A student bringing a lunch from home and another student buying a lunch from the cafeteria.    A student answering a question correctly in english class and another student dropping their pencil in science class.    A teacher calling on a student in math class and the bell ringing to signal the end of the period.        If and are independent events, then;   For events and      This means the probability of both events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities.    A coin is flipped, and a six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of getting heads and rolling a 6?       the Sample Space is  Possible coin outcomes   Possible die outcomes     Favorable Outcomes          Since flipping the coin and rolling the die are independent events              the probability of getting heads and a 6 is or       The probability of rain on a given day is , and the probability that a person is late to work is .     Find the probability that it rains    Find the probability that the person is late.    Find the probability that it rains and the person is late.    Find the probability that it does not rain but the person is late.    Find the probability that it rains or the person is late.          The probability that it rains is     The probability that it rains is .    The probability that the person is late is     The probability that the person is late is or .    Since rain and being late are independent,        The probability that it rains and the person is late is .    The probability that it does not rain is     Since rain and being late are independent        The probability that it does not rain but the person is late is or .    The probability that it rains or the person is late is           The probability that it rains or the person is late is or .         A coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting heads on both tosses?    A die is rolled, and a coin is tossed. What is the probability of rolling a 6 on the die and getting tails on the coin?    A bakery in Makongeni produces cakes. The probability that a cake is decorated with chocolate icing is . If two cakes are made independently, what is the probability that both cakes are decorated with chocolate icing?    A seed has a chance of germinating. If two seeds are planted independently, what is the probability that both seeds germinate?       Laws of Probability  Probability follows fundamental rules that help in calculating the likelihood of different events.   Addition Law of Probability   is used to find the probability of either one event or another occurring.     If two events cannot happen at the same time, they are mutually exclusive.  The probability of either event occurring is;        Since mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time,     A standard deck has cards, with hearts and clubs.  Since a single card cannot be both a heart and a club, the events are mutually exclusive.        =      =            the probability of drawing either a heart or a club is or           If two events can happen at the same time, we must subtract the probability of them happening together to avoid double counting.  The formula is;          A standard deck has   26 red cards    4 kings (2 of them are red)     now,               the probability of drawing either a red card or a king is or       A student can get an A, B, C, D, or F in a class. What is the probability that the student gets an A or a B?    A die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a 1 or a 6?    In a class of 30 students, 15 students like math, 10 students like chemistry, and 5 students like both math and chemistry. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student likes math or chemistry?    A bag contains 8 blue marbles and 5 yellow marbles. What is the probability of drawing a blue marble or a yellow marble?    In a class of 25 students, 12 play soccer, 10 play basketball, and 5 play both. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student plays soccer or basketball?    A bag contains letters of the word . What is the probability of selecting a vowel or the letter ?    A number is chosen between 1 and 10. What is the probability that it is a 3 or a 7?    A day of the week is chosen at random. What is the probability that it is a Saturday or a Sunday?      multiplication rule  The multiplication rule is used to find the probability of two events happening together.  For independent events (one event does not affect the other), the probability of both occurring is     This applies when the occurrence of one event does not change the probability of the other.  For Dependent Events     Here, is the probability that B happens given that A has already occurred.   A factory produces good items and defective items. A quality check is performed on two randomly selected items     Find the probability that both items are good.    Find the probability that at least one item is defective.    Are these events independent? Explain.        A student in Modegashe primary school was instructed to roll a Die and Toss a Coin.  What was the probability of rolling a 4 on the die and getting head on the coin?       Probability of rolling a 4 on a six-sided die is       Probability of getting heads on the coin is              the probability of rolling a 4 and flipping heads is or       A person has a probability of catching the first bus and an probability of catching the second bus (if they miss the first one)     Find the probability that the person catches the first bus.    Find the probability that the person misses the first bus but catches the second.    Find the probability that the person misses both buses.       Probability of catching the first bus:     Probability of missing the first bus     Probability of catching the second bus, given that the first bus was missed     Probability of missing the second bus, given that the first bus was missed        The probability of catching the first bus is directly given as     The probability of catching the first bus is or .    Missing the first bus   Catching the second bus   Since these events are dependent, we use the multiplication rule        The probability of missing the first bus but catching the second is or .    Missing the first bus   Missing the second bus   Again, using the multiplication rule        The probability of missing both buses is or .            A coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting heads on both tosses?    A die is rolled, and a coin is tossed. What is the probability of rolling a 6 and getting tails?    A weather forecast predicts a 60% chance of sunshine on Monday and a 70% chance of sunshine on Tuesday. Assuming these forecasts are independent, what is the probability of sunshine on both Monday and Tuesday?    A farmer in Gakuonyo plants two seeds. Each seed has a 75% chance of germinating. What is the probability that both seeds germinate?       Tree Diagrams and Independent Events  A tree diagram is a visual representation of all possible outcomes of an event.  It helps in organizing complex probability problems, especially for events that happen in sequence.      A student at Kenyaoni Senior School flips a coin and then spins a spinner with two equal sections, and .     Draw a tree diagram to represent the possible outcomes.    What is the probability that the coin lands on heads and the spinner lands on ?        A fair coin is tossed twice.     Draw a tree diagram showing all possible outcomes.    What is the probability of getting exactly one head?    What is the probability of getting at least one tail?    What is the probability of getting two heads?          Tree diagram showing all possible outcomes.       Probability of getting exactly one head  The favorable outcomes are .             Probability of getting at least one tail  The favorable outcomes are .             Probability of getting two heads  Only one outcome satisfies this condition: .            A bag contains 3 red and 2 blue balls. A ball is drawn without replacement.     Draw a tree diagram showing the possible outcomes.    What is the probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball?    What is the probability of drawing two red balls?    What is the probability of drawing at least one blue ball?       Here is the tree diagram     Assign Probabilities   The probability of drawing a red ball first is        If the first ball is red, the probability of drawing a red ball second is;       If the first ball is red, the probability of drawing a blue ball second is        The probability of drawing a blue ball first is:        If the first ball is blue, the probability of drawing a red ball second is:       If the first ball is blue, the probability of drawing another blue ball is:          Probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball  Favorable outcome: RB          Probability of drawing two red balls  Favorable outcome: RR          Probability of drawing at least one blue ball               A student at a shop is choosing a meal and a drink. This is what is available      ; Bread (B), Andazi (A), Chapati (Ch)     ; Juice (J), Soda (S)     The student buys one meal at one drink  what is the probability of ;   Choosing Andazi and Soda?    Choosing Juice as a drink?          The Sample Space where the possible meal-drink combinations are :     There are     the Tree Diagram       Now we find the probabilities   Probability of Choosing an Andazi and Soda          Probability of Choosing Juice as a Drink  There are 3 favorable outcomes that is (B, J) , (A, J), (Ch, J)  there are out of possible choices, so the probability is:               using Tree diagrams solve;    A coin is tossed three times. What is the probability of getting exactly two heads?    You have two bags. Bag 1 has 3 blue marbles and 1 red marble. Bag 2 has 2 blue marbles and 2 red marbles. You pick one marble from each bag. What is the probability of picking two blue marbles?    A store sells two types of phone cases. 30% are black, 70% are clear. Two phone cases are sold independently. What is the probability that one is black and the other is clear?    A student takes two true\/false quizzes. What is the probability that they get both quizzes completely correct?    A teacher assigns homework on Monday and Tuesday. There's a 80% chance of homework on Monday and a 80% chance on Tuesday. What is the probability there is homework on both days?    A student has a 60% chance of completing their math homework on time and a 75% chance of completing their English homework on time. Assuming these events are independent, what is the probability that the student completes both assignments on time?     "
