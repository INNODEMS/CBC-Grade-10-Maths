During a mathematics lesson, Grade 10 students were asked to classify the number
<alert><m>{45038}</m></alert>.
</p>

<p>
Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.


</p><ol marker="(1)">
<li>It is odd</li>
<li>It is prime</li>
<li>It is composite</li>
<li>It is even</li>
</ol>   </div></statement>
    <solution><div><p><alert>Worked Solution</alert></p>

<p>Given the number: <alert><m>{45038}</m></alert></p>

<hr/>

<p><alert>1. Testing whether the number is even or odd</alert></p>

<p>
A number is <alert>even</alert> if it is divisible by 2, and <alert>odd</alert> if it is not.
An easy way to check this is to look at the last digit.
</p>

<p>
The last digit is 8. Since this digit is even, the number is <alert>even</alert>.
</p>

<hr/>

<p><alert>2. Testing whether the number is prime or composite</alert></p>

<p>
A number is <alert>prime</alert> if it has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself.
It is <alert>composite</alert> if it has more than two positive divisors.
</p>

<p>
The number has a divisor other than 1 and itself, so it is <alert>composite</alert>.
</p>

<hr/>

<p><alert>Final classification:</alert> You  need to choose: </p>
<p>one option describing whether the number is even or odd, and in this case; </p><li>It is even</li>

<p>one option describing whether the number is prime or composite. Therefore;</p>
<li>It is composite</li>
