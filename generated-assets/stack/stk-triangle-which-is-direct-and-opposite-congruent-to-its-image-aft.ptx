    <solution><div><h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>
A reflection reverses orientation. Most triangles are therefore only
<em>oppositely congruent</em> to their mirror images.
</p>

<p>
An <alert>isosceles triangle</alert> has a line of symmetry, so under reflection
it can coincide with its image.
</p>

<p>
An <alert>equilateral triangle</alert> is even more symmetric: all sides and angles
are equal, so it is completely indistinguishable from its reflection.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, both <alert>isosceles</alert> and <alert>equilateral</alert> triangles
are accepted here.
