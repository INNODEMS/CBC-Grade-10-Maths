<solution><div><h3>Worked solution</h3>
<p>
Since the two polygons are similar, all corresponding lengths are in the same ratio.Here, the ratio of corresponding sides is:

</p>
<p><m>\frac{6}{5}.</m></p>
<p>For similar figures, areas scale with the square of the ratio of corresponding lengths.Therefore, the ratio of the areas is: </p>
<p><m>
\left(\frac{{6}}{{5}}\right)^2.
</m>
</p>
<p>
If the area of the smaller polygon is <m> {80} </m>, then the area of the larger hexagon is </p>
<p>
<m>
{80} \times \left(\frac{6}{5}\right)^2.={115.2} \,\text {cm}^2
</m>
</p></div></solution>
<answer><p><m>115.2</m></p></answer>
