    <solution><div><p><alert>Worked solution</alert></p>
<p>Find the probability of the following events below.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Find P(M) with <m>M:</m> "Missing the target with both shots".</p>
<p>To answer to this question, we denote the events <m>F</m>, <m>S</m> and <m>H</m> as follows:</p>
<p> <m>F:</m> "Hitting the target with the first shot".</p>
<p> <m>S:</m> "Hitting the target with the second shot".</p>
<p> <m>H:</m> "Hitting the target with both shots".</p>
<p>We get from the information provided by the text question that <m>P(F)={\frac{1}{2}} </m>, <m>P(S)={\frac{1}{5}} </m> and <m>P(H)={\frac{1}{10}} </m>.</p>
<p>Then <m> P(M)=1 - P(F \cup S) </m>, and <m> P(F \cup S)=(P(F)-P(H))+(P(S)-P(H))+P(H) </m>.</p>
<p>So <m>P(F \cup S)=({\frac{1}{2}} - {\frac{1}{10}})+({\frac{1}{5}}-{\frac{1}{10}})+{\frac{1}{10}}</m>.</p>
<p>Thus <m>P(F \cup S)={\frac{3}{5}}</m>, and <m> P(M)= 1-{\frac{3}{5}}</m>.</p>
<p>Therefore <m>P(M)={\frac{2}{5}}</m>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Find P(N) with <m>N:</m>"hitting with the first shot and missing with the second</p>
<p> We have: <m> P(N)=P(F)-P(H)</m>. Then</p>
<p><m> P(N)={\frac{1}{2}}-{\frac{1}{10}}</m></p>
<p>Therefore, <m> P(N)={\frac{2}{5}}</m> </p></div></solution>
    <answer><p><m>\frac{2}{5}</m></p></answer>
    <answer><p><m>\frac{2}{5}</m></p></answer>
