    <statement><div><p>Which of the following best describes a <alert>position vector</alert>?</p>
<p/><ol marker="(1)">
<li>A vector which may be translated to any point in space provided their direction and length remain unchanged.</li>
<li>A vector having magnitude zero and undefined direction.</li>
<li>A vector which always starts at the origin of the coordinate system.</li>
<li>A vector whose length may change as long as its direction remains the same.</li>
</ol> 
<p/></div></statement>
    <solution><div><h3>Worked Solution
</h3><p>A <alert>position vector</alert> describes the position of a point relative to the origin. Therefore, it is fixed to start at <m>(0,0)</m>.</p>
<p>Other vectors (free vectors) are defined only by length and direction and can be moved anywhere in space.</p></div></solution>
    <answer><p><m>(3)</m></p></answer>
