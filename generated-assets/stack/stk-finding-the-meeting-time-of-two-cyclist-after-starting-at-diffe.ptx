    <statement><div><p>A cyclist starts from a point travelling at a constant speed of <m>{12}</m> km/h.
Another cyclist starts from the same point, <m>{\frac{2}{9}}</m> hours later, travelling in the same direction at a constant speed of <m>{17}</m> km/h.</p>
<p>How long after the second cyclist starts will the second cyclist catch up with the first?</p>
<p> Time <m>=</m> <fillin characters="6" name="ans1"/> hours    </p></div></statement>
    <solution><div><h3>Worked Solution</h3>
<p>The first cyclist starts earlier, so the distance they cover before the second cyclist starts is given by its velocity multiplied by the time difference:<br/>
 <m>{12} \times {\frac{2}{9}} = {\frac{8}{3}} \text{ km}.</m></p>

<p>Since both cyclists travel in the same direction, the relative speed is:<br/> <m>{17} - {12} = {5} \text{ km/h}.</m></p>
<p>Therefore, time taken to catch up is:<br/> <m>\frac{{\frac{8}{3}}}{{5}} = {\frac{8}{15}} \text{ hours}.</m></p></div></solution>
    <answer><p><m>\frac{8}{15}</m></p></answer>
