<solution><div><h3>Worked Solution</h3>
<p>A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction <m> \frac{p}{q} </m> where <m> p </m> and <m> q </m> are integers and <m> q \neq 0 </m>.</p>
<p>The decimal representation of a rational number either terminates (stops at some point) or repeats (continues but has a repeating pattern).</p>
<p>The square root of a perfect square is a rational number.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the given numbers, the list of rational numbers are: (<m>{-9}</m>,<m>{\frac{12}{5}}</m>,<m>{5}</m>)</p></div></solution>
<answer><p><m>(1), (4), (6)</m></p></answer>
