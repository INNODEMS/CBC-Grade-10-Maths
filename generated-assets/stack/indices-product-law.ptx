    <solution><div><h3>Worked Solution</h3>

<p>
The total number of mangoes is found by multiplying the number of mangoes per jar by the number of jars.
</p>

<p>
We use the product law of indices:
</p>

<p>
<me>
a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}
</me>
</p>

<p>
So,
</p>

<p>
<me>
{5}^{1} \times {5}^{1}
= {5}^{2}
</me>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the total number of mangoes needed is:
</p>

<p>
<me>
\boxed{{5}^{2}}
</me>
</p></div></solution>
    <answer><p><m>25</m></p></answer>
