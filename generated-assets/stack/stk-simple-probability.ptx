    <statement><div><p>A box contains <m>{3}</m> bad tube(s) and <m>{7}</m> good tubes. Two are drawn out together. One of them is tested and found to be good. What is the probability that the other one is also good?</p> <p><fillin characters="5" name="ans1"/>  </p></div></statement>
    <solution><div><p>A box contains <m>{3}</m> bad tube(s) and <m>{7}</m> good tubes, so, in total <m>{10}</m> tubes.</p><p>Let <m>G_i=\{i^{th} \text{ tube is good}\}.</m><br/></p><p>The probability to draw one good tube out of the box is <m> G_1 = \displaystyle {\frac{7}{10}}. </m></p><p>If the first tube was good, then when the second tube is selected there are only <m>{6}</m> good tubes left in the box which now contains <m>{9}</m> tubes.</p><p>Hence,<nbsp/><span style="font-size: calc(0.90375rem + 0.045vw);"><m>\text{P}(G_2|G_1)= \displaystyle {\frac{2}{3}}.</m><nbsp/></span></p></div></solution>
    <answer><p><m>\frac{2}{3}</m></p></answer>
