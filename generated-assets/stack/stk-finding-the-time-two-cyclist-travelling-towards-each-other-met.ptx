    <statement><div><p>Two cyclists start <m>{70}</m> km apart and ride towards each other.
Cyclist A rides at <m>{17}</m> km/h for the first <m>{15}</m> minutes, then continues at <m>{14}</m> km/h.
Cyclist B rides at <m>{12}</m> km/h for the first <m>{37}</m> minutes, then continues at <m>{10}</m> km/h.</p>
<p>When do they meet?</p>
<p><fillin characters="6" name="ans1"/> hours  </p></div></statement>
    <solution><div><h3>Worked solution</h3>

<p>Cyclist A travels in the first <m>{15}</m> minutes:
<me> {17} \times \frac{{15}}{60} = {\frac{17}{4}} \text{ km}.</me>
</p>

<p>
Cyclist B travels in the first <m>{37}</m> minutes:
<me>
{12} \times \frac{{37}}{60} = {\frac{37}{5}} \text{ km}.
</me>
</p>

<p>
The remaining distance between them is:
<me>
{70} - ({\frac{17}{4}} + {\frac{37}{5}}) = {\frac{1167}{20}} \text{ km}.
</me>
</p>

<p>
After both cyclists change speed, they approach each other at:
<me>
{14} + {10} = {24} \text{ km/h}.
</me>
</p>
<p>
Cyclist B finishes the first stage after 37 minutes.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the time until both cyclists have changed speed is:
</p>
<p>
<me>
{\frac{37}{60}} \text{ hours}.
</me>
</p>
<p>
After that moment, the cyclists meet after an additional:
</p>
<p>
<m> \text{T=D/S}={\frac{389}{160}} \text{ hours}.</m>
</p>
<p>
Hence, the total time until they meet is:
</p>
<p>
<me>
{\frac{37}{60}} + {\frac{389}{160}} = {\frac{1463}{480}} \text{ hours}.
</me>
</p>


<p>Therefore, they meet at: <m>{\frac{1463}{480}}</m> hours</p></div></solution>
    <answer><p><m>\frac{1463}{480}</m></p></answer>
