<solution><div><p/><h3>Worked solution</h3>
<p>Two events <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are mutually exclusive if they do not occur at the same time, i.e. <m>C \cap D = \emptyset</m></p>
<p>By definition, an event <m>B</m> and its compliment <m>B^{\prime}</m> have the following properties:</p>
<p>1. Additivity: <m>B \cup B^{\prime} = S</m> where <m>S</m> is the entire sample space, and thus <m>P (B \cup B^{\prime}) = 1</m></p>
<p>2. Exclusivity: <m>B \cap B^{\prime} = \emptyset</m> and thus <m>P (B \cap B^{\prime}) = 0</m></p>
<p>This means that in particular, by Property 2, <m>B</m> and <m>B^{\prime}</m> are mutually exclusive.</p></div></solution>
