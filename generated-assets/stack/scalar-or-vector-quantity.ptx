    <statement><div><p>Identify whether each of the following physical quantities is a scalar or a vector.</p>
<ol class="HELM_parts">
<li><p> The capacity (volume) of a water tank. [ Scalar | Vector ]  </p></li>
<li><p> The force exerted by a person pushing a heavy box. [ Scalar | Vector ]  </p></li>
<li><p> The height of a classroom flagpole in meters. [ Scalar | Vector ]  </p></li>
<li><p> The relative velocity of two aircraft. [ Scalar | Vector ]  </p></li></ol></div></statement>
    <solution><ol class="HELM_parts">
<li>Volume measures the amount of space an object occupies without any direction, making it a scalar.</li>
<li>Force has both a size (magnitude) and a specific direction in which it is applied, making it a vector.</li>
<li>Height is a measurement of length. Length only has a size (magnitude) but no specific direction, so it is a scalar.</li>
<li>Velocity always implies both a speed and a specific direction of movement, so it is a vector quantity.</li>
