<statement><div><p>Assume that a noisy channel independently transmits symbols, say <m>0s</m> <m>{38}</m>% of the time and <m>1s</m> <m>{62}</m>% of the time. At the receiver, there is a <m>{3}</m>% chance of obtaining any particular symbol distorted. What is the probability of receiving a <m>1</m>, irrespective of which symbol is transmitted?

<solution><div><p>Worked solution</p>
<p>Given that;</p>
<p>Probability <m>0s \, \text{transmitted}</m>, <m>P(0)</m> is <m>{0.38}</m></p>
<p>Probability <m>1s \, \text{transmitted}</m>, <m>P(1)</m> is <m>{0.62}</m></p><m>P(1 \, \text{received} \,| \,0\, \text{transmitted}), \, P(1|0)</m> is <m>{0.03}</m>
<p>Hence, the probability of receiving a zero is</p>
<p>
<md>
<mrow>P(1) \amp = P(1 \, \text{received})</mrow>
<mrow>\amp = P(1|0)\cdot P(0)+P(1|1)\cdot P(1)</mrow>
<mrow>\amp = ({0.03})\cdot ({0.38})+(1-{0.03})\cdot ({0.62})</mrow>
<mrow>\amp = ({0.03}\cdot {0.38})+({0.97}\cdot {0.62})</mrow>
<mrow>\amp ={0.61}</mrow>
</md>
