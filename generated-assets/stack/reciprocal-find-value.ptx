<statement><p>If the reciprocal of <m> x </m> is <m> {\frac{2}{35}} </m>, find the value of <m> x </m>.</p>

<p><m> x = </m> <fillin characters="6" name="ans1"/>  </p></statement><solution><p>Worked Solution</p>
<p>Since the reciprocal of <m> x </m> is <m> {\frac{2}{35}} </m> and by definition, the reciprocal of a number 2 is 1 divided by the number 2: <m>\frac{1}{2}</m></p>
<p>Then: <m> \frac{1}{x} = {\frac{2}{35}} </m></p>
<p>Therefore, <m> x = {\frac{35}{2}} </m></p></solution><answer><p><m>\frac{35}{2}</m></p></answer>
