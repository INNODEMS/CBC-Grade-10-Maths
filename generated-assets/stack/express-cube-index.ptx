    <statement><div><p>A school has a computer storage server that saves student work in blocks. Each block holds repeated copies of the same unit file. One unit file has a size of <m>{3}</m> MB. After processing, the total saved size is <m>{243}</m> MB.</p>

<p>Write <m>{243}</m> in index form using base <m>{3}</m>.</p>

<p><fillin characters="15" name="ans1"/>  </p></div></statement>
    <solution><div><h3>Worked Solution</h3>

<p>The total saved size is <m>{243}</m> MB.</p>

<p>We check how many times <m>{3}</m> appears as a repeated factor:</p>

<p><m>{243} = {3} \times {3} \times \dots \times {3}</m> (repeated <m>{5}</m> times)</p>

<p>Thus, the index form is:</p>

<p><me>
{3}^{5}.
</me></p></div></solution>
    <answer><p><m>243</m></p></answer>
