    <solution><div><h3>Worked Solution</h3>

<p>
First, find the total number of sheets:
</p>

<p>
<me>
{7}^{2} \times {7}^{1}
= {7}^{3}
</me>
</p>

<p>
Next, divide by the number of sheets in each bundle:
</p>

<p>
<me>
\frac{{7}^{3}}{{7}^{1}}
= {7}^{{3} - {1}}
</me>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the number of bundles formed is:
</p>

<p>
<me>
\boxed{{7}^{2}}
</me>
