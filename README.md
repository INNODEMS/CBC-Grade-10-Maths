# CBC Grade 10 Mathematics Project

This repository contains the source files for the CBC Grade 10 Mathematics book, developed using [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) and will incoorporate [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/) exercises for student's personalised learning. PreTeXt is a powerful tool for creating high-quality educational materials, including textbooks, in multiple formats.

## Project Overview

This initiative is part of a larger project focused on developing digital Open Educational Resources (OERs) for Kenyan secondary schools. The main goal is to create a comprehensive and accessible digital mathematics textbook for Grade 10 students, fully aligned with the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC).

The initial version of the textbook will be developed by a team of 10 interns, who will design the content and assessment materials from scratch. Digital STACK questions, created separately, will be integrated into the subsections of the book to help students test and reinforce their understanding of key concepts.

The review process, covering both the textbook and the exercises, will provide an opportunity for broader contributions from teachers, students, and other education stakeholders. Development will remain continuous, incorporating feedback and suggestions to ensure the resource becomes increasingly responsive to the needs of teachers, learners, and CBC requirements, while also meeting international standards.

Furthermore, the textbook will be designed to be easily adaptable to different contexts, making it suitable for adoption by other countries seeking similar resources. 

The book will be available in multiple formats, including web, PDF, and print. The web version of the book will offer the digital assessments that will help students have a more engaging personalised learning experience from the immediate feedback STACK questions provides.
