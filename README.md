# CBC Grade 10 Mathematics Project

This repository contains the source files for the CBC Grade 10 Mathematics book, developed using [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org). PreTeXt is a powerful tool for creating high-quality educational materials, including textbooks, in multiple formats.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive and accessible mathematics textbook for Grade 10 students, aligned with the CBC (Competency-Based Curriculum). The book will be available in multiple formats, including web, PDF, and print.

## Getting Started

To contribute to or work on this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
    Use the green `<> Code` button at the top of this page to clone the repository to your local machine or open it in a GitHub Codespace.

2. **Set Up a Codespace**  
    If you prefer working in the cloud, you can use GitHub Codespaces:
    - Click the `<> Code` button.
    - Select the "Codespaces" tab.
    - Click "Create codespace on main."

    This will open a browser-based VS Code environment with everything pre-configured for this project.

3. **Build the Book**  
    Use the provided PreTeXt tools to build and preview the book. Instructions for building the book can be found in the documentation within this repository.

# PreTeXt Codespace

Use this template repository to quickly start a new [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) project entirely in the cloud, using GitHub Codespaces.  

## Instructions

Look for the green button at the top right of this page.  If the button says `Use this template`, then you are ready to create a new repository for your project.  Click on the button and select "Create a new repository".  On the next page, give your project a name, select public or private (this can be changed later), and click the "Create repository from template" button.

You now have a GitHub repository saved in your account.  You can come back to that page any time you want to work on your project (note the URL or else find it in the list of your repositories when you log in to GitHub).

To start work on your project, go to the green button at the top of *your* repository's page, which will say `<> Code`.  

1. Click on this button.
2. Click on the tab that says "Codespaces."
3. Click "Create codespace on main."

This take a minute or two (just the first time; later this will be much faster) and then open a browser version of VS Code with everything set up to start working.  It will generate a new pretext book (and replace this README with one you can edit for your project). 

Next time you want to work on your book, return to your newly created repository, go to the green `<> Code` button, and select the codespace you previously created.  If you don't see that codespace (perhaps you deleted it to save space), you can always create a new codespace.
