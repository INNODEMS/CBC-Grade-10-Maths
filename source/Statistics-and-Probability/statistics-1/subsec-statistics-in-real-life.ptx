             How to make informed decisions based on data:
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the problem or question to be addressed.</li>
                <li>Collect relevant data through surveys, experiments, or observations.</li>
                <li>Organize the data into useful forms such as frequency tables (both grouped and ungrouped).</li>
                <li>Represent the data visually using tables, histograms, and frequency polygons to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.</li>
                <li>Interpret the data to draw conclusions.</li>

                             However, there is a portion of students who may benefit from additional support. 
                            Therefore, the principal could consider introducing an extra Mathematics clinic, but it may be more effective to target it towards students who are struggling or spending less time on Mathematics rather than making it compulsory.

                            Based on the estimated mean number of customers, Supermarket A has a higher average (150) compared to Supermarket B (105). 
                             Additionally, Supermarket A is more consistent with a higher frequency in the middle ranges. 
                            Therefore, it would be advisable for the company to expand Supermarket A as it has a larger customer base and more consistent traffic.

                           The histogram shows that passenger numbers are distributed between 45 and 70, with the highest frequency in the 45 and 50 passenger values.

                            Since the average number of passengers is 55, a 50-seater bus is not sufficient. A larger bus is recommended.
