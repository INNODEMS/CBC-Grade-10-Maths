            The median is the middle value of a data set.
        </p>
        <p>
            To find median, data must first be arranged in ascending or descending order.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the number of observations is odd, the median is the value at the middle position.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: For the data set <m>45, 56, 60, 67, 68, 70, 73, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 95</m>, the median is <m>73</m> because it is the middle value when the data is arranged in order.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the number of observations is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example: For the data set <m>45, 56, 60, 67, 68, 70, 73, 78</m>, the median is <m>(68 + 70) / 2 = 69</m> because there are two middle values (68 and 70) when the data is arranged in order.
        </p>
    </insight>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The ages of 6 students are: <m>12, 15, 14, 13, 16, 15</m>. Find the median age.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First, we arrange the ages in ascending order: <m>12, 13, 14, 15, 15, 16</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since there are 6 observations (an even number), the median is the average of the two middle values, which are 14 and 15.
            </p>
            <p>
                Median = <m>(14 + 15) / 2 = 14.5</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The following data set represents the number of goals scored by a football team in 20 matches:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1,</m><m> 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Determine the median of the data set.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First, we arrange the data in ascending order: 
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since there are 20 observations (an even number), the median is the average of the two middle values, which are the 10th and 11th values in the ordered list.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 10th value is 3 and the 11th value is also 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Median = <m>(3 + 3) / 2 = 3</m>.
            </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The weekly earnings (in Ksh) of 5 engineers in a company are as follows:
            </p>
            <p>  
               <m>2000, 2500, 3000, 4500, 10000</m>

        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First, we arrange the earnings in ascending order: <m>2000, 2500, 3000, 4500, 10000</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since there are 5 observations (an odd number), the median is the value at the middle position, which is the 3rd value in the ordered list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Median = <m>3000</m> Ksh.
