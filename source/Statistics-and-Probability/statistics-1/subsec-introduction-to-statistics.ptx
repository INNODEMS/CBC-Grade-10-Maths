    <title>Introduction to Statistics</title>
    <introduction>       
        <p>
            In everyday life, individuals, organizations, and governments make decisions based on information. 
             Schools analyse learners' performance, hospitals record patient data, businesses track sales trends, farmers decide when to plant crops and governments collect population data to plan development projects.
             This systematic process of gathering, organizing, analysing, and interpreting the information above is known as <term>Statistics</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Statistics enables us to transform raw data into meaningful information that supports informed decision-making. 
            Understanding where data comes from and how it is collected is essential before organizing, representing, and interpreting it.
