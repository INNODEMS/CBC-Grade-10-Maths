    <title>Grouped Data</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            When dealing with small sets of data, it is easy to <alert>list</alert> and <alert>analyze</alert> every individual value. However, in the real world, we often encounter datasets with <em>hundreds</em> or <em>thousands</em> of entries, such as the heights of all students in a school or the daily sales of a large store. Listing each number individually becomes impractical and difficult to interpret. To manage this, we organize data into groups or <term>class intervals</term>. In this section, we will learn how to summarize large datasets using frequency distribution tables and how to estimate measures of central tendency the <alert>mean</alert>, <alert>median</alert>, and <alert>mode</alert> for data that has been grouped.
