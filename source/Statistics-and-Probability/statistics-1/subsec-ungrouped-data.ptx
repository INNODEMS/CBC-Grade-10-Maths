    <title>Ungrouped Data</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Ungrouped data refers to raw data collected from an experiment, survey, or observation that has not been organized into categories, classes, or intervals. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is simply a list of individual values without any summarization or grouping.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you record the ages of 10 people as: 12, 15, 14, 13, 16, 15, 14, 12, 13, 15 this is ungrouped data because each value is listed exactly as collected.
