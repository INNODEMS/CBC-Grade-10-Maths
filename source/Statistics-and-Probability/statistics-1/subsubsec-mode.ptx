                Your class is scheduling a favourable revision time. 
                Students voted for their preferred time and the recorded votes are:

        <p>
            The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set.
        </p>
        <p>
            A data set may have:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                            One mode (unimodal)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                            Two modes (bimodal)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                            More than two modes (multimodal)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                            No mode (if all values occur once)
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The mode is useful in identifying the most common occurrence in real-life situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mode does not require calculation — it requires counting and comparison.
        </p>

            <p>
                The following data set represents the number of goals scored by a football team in 20 matches:

                <m>2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1,</m><m> 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2</m>

        </statement>
