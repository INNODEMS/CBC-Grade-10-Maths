    <introduction>
        <p>
            Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing
            and interpreting data in order to make decisions or draw conclusions.

            In our daily lives, we are constantly surrounded by data  from school exam results, sports scores, population figures, business sales, weather reports, to health records.

            Understanding statistics helps us make sense of this information and use it to solve real life problems.
