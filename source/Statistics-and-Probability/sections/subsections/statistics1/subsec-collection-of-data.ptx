            Data can be obtained from primary sources, which are original first-hand data collected directly for a specific purpose (e.g., surveys, interviews),    
        </p>
        <p>
            secondary sources, which are previously collected data used for a different purpose (e.g., government reports, research articles), 
        </p>
        <p>
            and tertiary sources, which summarize and compile information from primary and secondary sources (e.g., dictionaries, textbooks, encyclopedias).
