    <title>probability of simple events</title>

    <p>
        A simple event is an event that consists of only one outcome in the sample space.
    </p>
    <p>
        The probability of a simple event is calculated using the formula
        <md>
            <mrow>\textbf{P(E)}\amp = \frac{\textbf{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\textbf{Number of Outcomes}}</mrow>

                A bag contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. If one ball is picked at random, what is the probability that it is red?

                Probability of drawing a red ball is given by:

            <p>
                <m>\textbf{P(Red)}=\frac{\textbf{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\textbf{Number of Outcomes}} = \frac{5}{8}=\textbf{0.625}</m>
            </p>

                the probability of picking a red ball is <m>0.628</m> or <m>62.5\%</m>
