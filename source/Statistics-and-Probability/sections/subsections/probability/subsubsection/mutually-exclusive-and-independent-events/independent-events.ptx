    <title>Independent Events</title>
    <p>
        Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Example}</m>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A student choosing to study math and another student choosing to read a book in the library
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are typically independent choices.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A student bringing a lunch from home and another student buying a lunch from the cafeteria.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A student answering a question correctly in english class and another student dropping their pencil in science class.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A teacher calling on a student in math class and the bell ringing to signal the end of the period.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Formula}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent events, then;
        <md>
            <mrow> P(\textbf{A and B}) = \textbf{P(A)} \times \textbf{P(B)} </mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        For  events  <m>\textbf{A}</m> and <m>\textbf{B}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <md>
            <mrow> \textbf{P}(\textbf{A} \cup \textbf{B}) \, = \, \textbf{P(A)} \times \textbf{P(B)} </mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        This means the probability of both events occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities.
    </p>

                Therefore, <m>\textbf{P}(\textbf{R}^{c})</m> will represent the probability that it does not rain and <m>\textbf{P}(\textbf{L}^{c})</m>  the probability that the person is not late.
