    <p>
        Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that if one event happens, the other cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
        If <m>\textbf{A} </m> and <m>\text{B}</m> are mutually exclusive events, then;
        <md>
            <mrow> \textbf{P(A and B) = 0} </mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        The probability of either <m>\textbf{A}</m> or <m>\textbf{B}</m> occurring is;
        <md>
            <mrow>\textbf{P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)} </mrow>

                Since rolling a 3 and rolling a 5 are mutually exclusive events;
