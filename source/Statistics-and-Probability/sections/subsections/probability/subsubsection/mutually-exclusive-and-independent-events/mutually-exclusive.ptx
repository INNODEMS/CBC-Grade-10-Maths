    <p>
        Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that if one event happens, the other cannot.

                Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time.
                Since a card cannot be both a Heart and a Spade, the events are mutually exclusive.
