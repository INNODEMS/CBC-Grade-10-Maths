    <title>Addition Law of Probability</title>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{The addition law}</m> is used to find the probability of either one event or another occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{mutually exclusive events}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        If two events cannot happen at the same time, they are mutually exclusive. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The probability of either event occurring is;
    </p>
    <p>
        <md>
            <mrow> \textbf{P}(\textbf{A} \cup \textbf{B} ) \, = \, \textbf{P(A) + P(B)} </mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        <md>
            <mrow>\textbf{P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)}</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time, <m>\textbf{P}(\textbf{A} \cap \textbf{B} ) \, = \, 0</m>
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A standard deck has <m>52</m> cards, with <m>13</m> hearts and <m>13</m> clubs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since a single card cannot be both a heart and a club, the events are mutually exclusive.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <ul>

                            <m>P(\textbf{Heart})</m> = <m>\frac{13}{52}</m>

                    </li>

                    <mrow>= \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2}</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                the probability of drawing either a heart or a club is <m>0.5</m> or <m>50\%</m>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{non-mutually exclusive events}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        If two events can happen at the same time, we must subtract the probability of them happening together to avoid double counting.
    </p>

        The formula is;
