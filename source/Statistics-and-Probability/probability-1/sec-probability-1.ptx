    <title>Probability 1</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            What is the chance that it will rain tomorrow? If I choose a number between 1 and 10, and then flip a coin, what is the chance that I will choose a number less than 4 and get heads? These are examples of questions that can be answered using probability. In this section, we will learn about the basic concepts of probability, including how to calculate probabilities of events and how to use tree diagrams to represent probabilities.

            Understanding probability is important in many real-life situations, such as making decisions based on uncertain outcomes, analyzing data, and predicting future events. By the end of this section, you will have a solid foundation in probability that will help you in your studies and in everyday life.
