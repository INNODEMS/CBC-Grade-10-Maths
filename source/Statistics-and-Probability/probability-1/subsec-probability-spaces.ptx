            A <term>random experiment</term> is a process that can be repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes, but the outcome of any particular trial cannot be predicted with certainty. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of random experiments include tossing a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a card from a deck. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Sample space</term> is a set containing all possible outcomes of a random experiment. It is usually denoted by <m>\Omega</m> or <alert>S</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Outcome</term> is a single result from a trial of a random experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Event</term> is a collection of outcomes from the sample space. An event can consist of one outcome or multiple outcomes. For example, if we are tossing a coin, the event "getting heads" consists of the single outcome H, while the event "getting at least one head when tossing two coins" consists of the outcomes HH, HT, and TH.

                Consider the experiment of rolling a pair of <m>6</m>-sided dice. For each die, we can observe a
                number from <m>1</m> to <m>6</m>. If we paired the observations from each die, we would have a single
                observation from the pair. For example, if the first die lands on <m>2</m> and the second lands on
                <m>5</m>, we can write down this outcome as (2,5).
