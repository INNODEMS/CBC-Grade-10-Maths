                Grade 10 learners went on a field trip to a weather station to learn about how meteorologists use probability to predict the weather.
            </p>
            <p>
                The weather forecast says:
                There is a 70% chance of rain tomorrow.

                A class of 30 students is planning a revision session for their upcoming exams. 
                They have three time slots to choose from: 4 PM, 5 PM, and 6 PM. 
                The students were asked to vote for their preferred time slot, and the results are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            12 students prefer 4 PM
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            10 students prefer 5 PM

                            8 students prefer 6 PM
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the votes, determine the probability of each time slot being chosen for the revision session.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                To find the probability of each time slot being chosen, we divide the number of votes for each time slot by the total number of students (30).
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Probability of 4 PM = 12/30 = 2/5 = 0.4
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Probability of 5 PM = 10/30 = 1/3 ≈ 0.33
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Probability of 6 PM = 8/30 = 4/15 ≈ 0.27
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the probabilities of each time slot being chosen are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            4 PM: 0.4 (40%)

                        <p>
                            5 PM: 0.33 (33%)

                        <p>
                            6 PM: 0.27 (27%)

                A weather forecast predicts a 60% chance of rain tomorrow. 
                If you have an outdoor event planned, what is the probability that it will not rain?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The probability of rain is 60%, or 0.6. 
                The probability of no rain is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4, or 40%.

                A bag contains 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. 
                If you randomly draw one ball from the bag, what is the probability of drawing a red ball?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The total number of balls in the bag is 5 + 3 + 2 = 10.
                The number of red balls is 5.
                Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball is 5/10 = 1/2 = 0.5 (50%).

                A student is taking a multiple-choice test with 4 questions, each having 3 possible answers (A, B, C). 
                If the student guesses on all questions, what is the probability of getting at least one question correct?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The probability of getting a question wrong is 2/3 (since there are 2 incorrect answers out of 3).
            </p>
            <p>
                The probability of getting all 4 questions wrong is (2/3)^4 = 16/81.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the probability of getting at least one question correct is 1 - 16/81 = 65/81 ≈ 0.80 (80%).

                                The probability that a student arrives on time is <m>1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85%)</m>.

                                Out of <m>200</m> students, we can expect <m>0.15 \times 200 = 30</m> students to arrive late.

                                One strategy the school could use to reduce lateness is to implement a reward system for students who consistently arrive on time, such as giving out small prizes.
