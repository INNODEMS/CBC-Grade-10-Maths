            <p>
                A class of <m>30</m> students is planning a revision session for their upcoming exams. 
                They have three time slots to choose from: <m>4</m> PM, <m>5</m> PM, and <m>6</m> PM. 
                The students were asked to vote for their preferred time slot, and the results are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>12</m> students prefer <m>4</m> PM
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <m>10</m> students prefer <m>5</m> PM
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>8</m> students prefer <m>6</m> PM

            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the votes, determine the probability of each time slot being chosen for the revision session.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                To find the probability of each time slot being chosen, we divide the number of votes for each time slot by the total number of students (<m>30</m>).
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Probability of <m>4</m> PM <m>= \frac{12}{30} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Probability of <m>5</m> PM <m>= \frac{10}{30} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Probability of <m>6</m> PM <m>= \frac{8}{30} = \frac{4}{15} \approx 0.27</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the probabilities of each time slot being chosen are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>4</m> PM: <m>0.4</m> (<m>40\%</m>)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>5</m> PM: <m>0.33</m> (<m>33\%</m>)

                        </p>
                    </li>

                A weather forecast predicts a <m>60\%</m> chance of rain tomorrow. 
                If you have an outdoor event planned, what is the probability that it will not rain?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The probability of rain is <m>60\%</m>, or <m>0.6</m>. 
                The probability of no rain is <m>1 - 0.6 = 0.4</m>, or <m>40\%</m>.

                A bag contains <m>5</m> red balls, <m>3</m> blue balls, and <m>2</m> green balls. 
                If you randomly draw one ball from the bag, what is the probability of drawing a red ball?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The total number of balls in the bag is <m>5 + 3 + 2 = 10</m>.
                The number of red balls is <m>5</m>.
                Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball is <m>\frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 </m> (<m>50\%</m>).
            </p>

                A student is taking a multiple-choice test with <m>4</m> questions, each having <m>3</m> possible answers (A, B, C). 
                If the student guesses on all questions, what is the probability of getting at least one question correct?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The probability of getting a question wrong is <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> (since there are <m>2</m> incorrect answers out of <m>3</m>).
            </p>
            <p>
                The probability of getting all <m>4</m> questions wrong is <m>\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 = \frac{16}{81}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the probability of getting at least one question correct is <m>1 - \frac{16}{81} = \frac{65}{81} \approx 0.80\%</m>.

                                Out of <m>100</m> products, we can expect <m>0.02 \times 100 = 2</m> products to be defective.

                                Probability is important in quality control because it helps manufacturers assess the likelihood of defects and take measures to reduce them, ensuring that products meet quality standards and customer satisfaction.

                                One strategy the school could use to reduce lateness is to implement a reward system for students who consistently arrive on time, such as giving out small prizes.
