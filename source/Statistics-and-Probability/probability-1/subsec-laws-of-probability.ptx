    <title>Laws of Probability</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Two key laws of probability are the <term>addition rule</term> and the <term>multiplication rule</term>. These will be very useful when we want to calculate the probability of combined events, such a flipping a coin and rolling a die at the same time.

        <p>
            Importantly, they build upon the ideas of mutually exclusive and independent events that we have already learned about. The addition rule helps us calculate the probability of either one event or another event happening, while the multiplication rule helps us calculate the probability of both events happening together.
