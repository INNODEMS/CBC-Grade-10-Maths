    <title>Laws of Probability</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The laws of probability are fundamental principles that guide us in calculating and understanding the chances of events occurring.
            These rules provide a systematic way to solve probability problems in mathematics and to analyze outcomes in random experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Important laws such as the addition rule, multiplication rule, and complement rule help us determine the likelihood of single or combined events and compute probabilities accurately.
