                    (a) Yes, events A and B are mutually exclusive because they cannot happen at the same time. The student cannot walk to school and take the bus on the same day. Therefore, if event A occurs (the student walked), event B cannot occur (the student took the bus), and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p xml:id="auto_9h8l7n1s">
                    (b) To find the probability that the student either walked or took the bus to school on a randomly chosen day, we first count the number of days the student walked and the number of days they took the bus.

                    The student walked on 5 days and took the bus on 5 days. Since these events are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities:

                    \[
                    P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
                    \]

                    The probability of walking is \( P(A) = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) and the probability of taking the bus is \( P(B) = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \).

                    Therefore,

                    \[
                    P(A \text{ or } B) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
                    \]

                    So, the probability that the student either walked or took the bus to school on a randomly chosen day is 1, meaning it is certain that they did one of those two things.

                    (a) Yes, the events "drawing a diamond" and "drawing a club" are mutually exclusive because they cannot happen at the same time. A card cannot be both a diamond and a club simultaneously. Therefore, if you draw a diamond, you cannot draw a club, and if you draw a club, you cannot draw a diamond.
                </p>
                <p xml:id="auto_9h8l7n1s">
                    (b) To find the probability of drawing either a diamond or a club, we first determine the number of diamonds and clubs in a standard deck of 52 cards. There are 13 diamonds and 13 clubs in the deck.

                    Since these events are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities:

                    \[
                    P(\text{diamond or club}) = P(\text{diamond}) + P(\text{club})
                    \]

                    The probability of drawing a diamond is \( P(\text{diamond}) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4} \) and the probability of drawing a club is \( P(\text{club}) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4} \).

                    Therefore,

                    \[
                    P(\text{diamond or club}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
                    \]

                    So, the probability of drawing either a diamond or a club is \( \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.

                    (b) To find the probability of either picking card A or picking card F, we first determine the total number of cards, which is 5. Since there is only one card A and one card F, the probability of picking card A is \( P(A) = \frac{1}{5} \) and the probability of picking card F is \( P(F) = \frac{1}{5} \).

                    Since these events are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities:

                    P(A \text{ or } F) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
                    \]

                    So, the probability of either picking card A or picking card F is \( \frac{2}{5} \) or 40%.
