    <insight>
        <p>
            The addition rule of probability helps us find the probability that 
            <em>at least one</em> of two events occurs. 
            If A and B are two events, the probability that event A or event B 
            (or both) occurs is given by:
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, <m>P(A \cap B)</m> represents the probability that both 
            events A and B occur at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We subtract <m>P(A \cap B)</m> because the outcomes that belong 
            to both events would otherwise be counted twice.
        </p>
        <p>
            This rule is used when events A and B are <term>not mutually exclusive</term>, 
            meaning they can occur together.
        </p>
    </insight>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A standard deck of cards contains <m>52</m> cards. 
                There are <m>13</m> hearts and <m>13</m> clubs in the deck.
                If one card is drawn at random, find the probability that the card is 
                a <term>heart or a club</term>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Since a single card cannot be both a heart and a club at the same time, 
                the two events are <term>mutually exclusive</term>.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, find the probability of each event:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <m>P(Heart) = \frac{13}{52}</m>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <m>P(Club) = \frac{13}{52}</m>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Because the events are mutually exclusive, we apply the addition rule:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md number="yes">
                    <mrow> P(Heart or Club) \amp = P(Heart) + P(Club) </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \frac{13}{52} + \frac{13}{52} </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2}</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the probability of drawing either a heart or a club is 
                <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, which is equal to <m>0.5</m> or <m>50\%</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>

   <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                You roll a fair six-sided die. What is the probability of rolling 
                a number divisible by <m>2</m> or <m>3</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
            <p>
                A fair six-sided die has <m>6</m> equally likely outcomes:
                <m>\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                List the numbers divisible by <m>2</m>:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\{2,4,6\}</m> → <m>3</m> numbers
            </p>

            <p>
                List the numbers divisible by <m>3</m>:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\{3,6\}</m> → <m>2</m> numbers
            </p>

            <p>
                We want the numbers divisible by <m>2</m> <em>or</em> <m>3</m> 
                (the union of the two sets).
            </p>

            <p>
                Notice that <m>6</m> appears in both sets, so we must avoid 
                counting it twice.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using the inclusion–exclusion principle:
            </p>

            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>
                        P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)
                    </mrow>
                </md>
            </p>

            <p>
                Compute each probability:
            </p>
            <p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <m>P(\text{divisible by 2}) = \frac{3}{6}</m>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <m>P(\text{divisible by 3}) = \frac{2}{6}</m>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <m>P(\text{divisible by both 2 and 3}) = P(\text{divisible by 6}) = \frac{1}{6}</m>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                 <md>
                    <mrow>
                        P(\text{divisible by 2 or 3}) 
                        = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} - \frac{1}{6}
                        = \frac{4}{6}
                        = \frac{2}{3}
                    </mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
           
            <p>
                Therefore, the probability of rolling a number divisible by 
                <m>2</m> or <m>3</m> is <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>.
            </p>
