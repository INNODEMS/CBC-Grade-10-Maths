    <title>Application Of Quadratic Equations To Real Life Situations.</title>
    <p>
        Quadratic equations are a type of mathematical equation that can be used to describe many different real-life situations. 
        Whether you're throwing a ball in the air, trying to maximize the area of a garden, or calculating profits for a business, 
        quadratic equations can help solve problems that involve relationships with squared terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section, we will learn how to recognize real-life situations that can be modeled by quadratic equations, 
        how to set them up, and how to solve them step by step.
    </p>
    <p>
        A quadratic equation is an equation that can be written in the form:
        <me>
            ax^2 + bx + c = 0
        </me>
        where, 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are real numbers or constants,
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>x</m> is the unknown variable
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    and <m>a \neq 0</m> beacuse if <m>a</m> is <m>0,</m> it would npt be a quadratic
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Quadratic equations show up in many situations, especially when something is changing in a way that involves squares (like height, area, or profit).
    </p>
    <p>
        Lets take a look at some of the situations <em><term>Quadratic Equations</term></em> is involved in real life situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>1. \, Projectile \, Motion (Throwing \, a \, Ball).</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most common real-life situations for quadratic equations is <term>projectile motion</term>, such as when you throw a ball in the air. 
        The height of the ball over time can be described by a quadratic equation.
    </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A ball is thrown into the air from a height of <m>2</m> meters with an initial upward velocity of <m>6</m> meters per second. 
                The height of the ball after <m>t</m> seconds is given by:
                <me>
                    h(t) = -5t^2 + 6t + 2
                </me>
                where <m>h(t)</m> is the height of the ball in meters and <m>t</m> is the time in seconds. Find when the ball reaches the ground.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First we have to set the height equal to zero beacuse the ball reaches the ground when its height is zero.
                <me>
                    -5t^2 + 6t + 2 = 0
                </me>                
            </p>
            <p>
                Solve the equation using the quadratic formula;
                <me>
                     t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
                </me>                
            </p>
            <p>
                For this equation, <m>a = -5,</m> <m>b = 6</m> and <m>c = 2.</m>
                Now you need to subsitute these values into the formula:
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                     t = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4(-5)(2)}}{2(-5)}
                </me>                
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                     t = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 40}}{-10}
                </me>                
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                     t = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{76}}{-10}
                </me>                
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                     t = \frac{-6 \pm 8.717}{-10}
                </me>                
            </p>
            <p>
                From this you need to find the two possible solutions for time:
                <me>
                     t_{1} = \frac{-6 \pm 8.717}{-10} = -0.2717 \, seconds
                </me>
                (this is not a valid solution, since time can <m>t</m> be negative)
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                     t_{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 8.717}{-10} = 1.4717 \, seconds
                </me>                
            </p>
            <p>
                The ball will hit the ground after approximately <m>1.4717 \, seconds</m>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>
    
    <p>
        <m>2. \, Maximizing \, Area \, (Optimization \, Problem).</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Quadratic equations are also used in optimization problems. 
        These are problems where you want to maximize or minimize something, like the area of a garden.
    </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A farmer wants to build a rectangular fence with 120 meters of fencing. 
                The length of the garden is 30 meters longer than the width. What should the dimensions of the garden be to maximize the area?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                
            </p>
        </solution>
    
    </example>

    <p>
        <m>3. Business Applications (Profit Function)</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Businesses often use quadratic equations to model their profit. 
        For example, the profit a company makes from selling a product can be modeled by a quadratic equation.
    </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A company's profit <m>P(x)</m> from selling <m>x</m> units of a product is given by the equation:
                <me>
                    P(x) = -x^2 + 20x - 50
                </me>
                Find how many units the company needs to sell to have no profit (i.e., when the profit is zero).
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>
