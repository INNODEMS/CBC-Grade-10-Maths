    <title>Application Of Quadratic Equations To Real Life Situations.</title>
    <p>
        <em><term>Quadratic equations</term></em> are a type of mathematical equation that can be used to describe many different <em><term>real-life</term></em> situations. 
        Whether you're throwing a ball in the air, trying to maximize the area of a garden, or calculating profits for a business, 
        quadratic equations can help solve problems that involve relationships with squared terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section, we will learn how to recognize real-life situations that can be modeled by quadratic equations, 
        how to set them up, and how to solve them step by step.
    </p>
    <p>
        A quadratic equation is an equation that can be written in the form:
        <me>
            ax^2 + bx + c = 0
        </me>
        where, 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are real numbers or constants,
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>x</m> is the unknown variable
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    and <m>a \neq 0</m> beacuse if <m>a</m> is <m>0,</m> it would npt be a quadratic
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Quadratic equations show up in many situations, especially when something is changing in a way that involves squares (like height, area, or profit).
    </p>
    <p>
        Lets take a look at some of the situations <em><term>Quadratic Equations</term></em> is involved in real life situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>1. \, Projectile \, Motion (Throwing \, a \, Ball).</m>

    </image>
    <p>
        One of the most common real-life situations for quadratic equations is <term>projectile motion</term>, such as when you throw a ball in the air. 
        The height of the ball over time can be described by a quadratic equation.
    </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                A rock is dropped from a height of <m>50</m> meters. 
                Its height above the ground at time <m>t</m> is given by
                <me>
                    h(t) = 5t^2 + 50.
                </me>
                 Use factorization to determine how long it will take for the rock to reach the ground.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The height of the rock above the ground is given by:
                <me>
                    h(t) = -5t^2 + 50
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                To find when the rock reaches the ground, set <m>h(t) = 0</m>:
                <me>
                    -5t^2 + 50 = 0
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Simplify the equation:
                <me>
                    -5t^2 = -50
                </me>
                <me>
                    t^2 = 10
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Solve for <m>t</m>:
                <me>
                    t = \pm \sqrt{10}
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since time cannot be negative, <m>t = \sqrt{10}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the rock will take approximately <m>\sqrt{10} \approx 3.16</m> seconds to reach the ground.
            </p>

        <m>2. \, Maximizing \, Area \, (Optimization \, Problem).</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Quadratic equations are also used in optimization problems. 
        These are problems where you want to maximize or minimize something, like the area of a garden.
    </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The length of a rectangle is <m>3</m> meters more than its width. If the area of the rectangle is <m>54</m> square meters, 
                find the dimensions of the rectangle by factoring the quadratic equation.

            </image>
        </statement>
        <solution>            
            <p>
                Let the width of the rectangle be <m>x</m>. Then the length is <m>x + 3</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The area of the rectangle is given by:
                <me>
                    x(x + 3) = 54
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Expand and rearrange into standard quadratic form:
                <me>
                    x^2 + 3x - 54 = 0
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Factorize the quadratic equation:
                <me>
                    (x + 9)(x - 6) = 0
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Solve for <m>x</m>:
                <me>
                    x = -9 \, \text{or} \, x = 6
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since width cannot be negative, <m>x = 6</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dimensions of the rectangle are:
                <me>
                    \text{Width} = 6 \, \text{meters}, \, \text{Length} = 6 + 3 = 9 \, \text{meters}.
                </me>
                Since the width cannot be negative, the width is <m>6</m> meters, and lenght is <m>6 + 3 = 9</m> meters.
            </p>
        </solution>
    
    </example>

    <p>
        <m>3. Business Applications (Profit Function)</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        Businesses often use quadratic equations to model their profit. 
        For example, the profit a company makes from selling a product can be modeled by a quadratic equation.
    </p>

    <example>

        <statement>
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                A company's profit <m>P(x)</m> from selling <m>x</m> units of a product is given by the equation:
                <me>
                    P(x) = -x^2 + 15x - 50
                </me>
                Find how many units the company needs to sell to have no profit (i.e., when the profit is zero).
            </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
            <p>
                To find when the company has no profit, set <m>P(x) = 0</m>:
                <me>
                    -x^2 + 20x - 50 = 0
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiply through by <m>-1</m> to simplify:
                <me>
                    x^2 - 20x + 50 = 0
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Factorize the quadratic equation:
                <me>
                    (x - 10)(x - 5) = 0
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Solve for <m>x</m>:
                <me>
                    x = 10 or x = 5
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the company will have no profit when it sells either <m>5</m> units or <m>10</m> units.
            </p>
        </solution>
