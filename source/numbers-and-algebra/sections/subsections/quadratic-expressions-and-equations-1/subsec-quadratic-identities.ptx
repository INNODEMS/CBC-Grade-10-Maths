                Consider the following equation:
                <md>
                    <mrow>2(x + 3) \amp = 2x + 6</mrow>

            Suppose we have a equation <m>P</m> and <m>Q.</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            In mathematics, an equation <m>P = Q</m> is called an <em><term>identity</term></em> if the following conditions are satisfied:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Both sides of the equality relation contain some variables.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Both the sides give the same value when the variable is substituted with a particular constant.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

        </p>
            <p>
                If an equation satisfies the two conditions mentioned above, it is known as an identity. 
                There are many mathematical relations that can be classified as identities, but it's not necessary to memorize all of them. 
                However, certain key identities in algebra are essential, as they simplify calculations.

            Common quadratic identities are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Difference of squares.

        <title>Difference of Squares.</title>

        <p>
            The <em><term>Difference of Squares</term></em> is an identity that applies when you have two terms that are perfect squares and are being subtracted from each other. 
            The identity states:
            <md>
                <mrow>a^2 - b^2 \amp = (a - b)(a + b) </mrow>
            </md>
            This means that the difference between two squares can be factored into the product of two binomials: 
            one where the terms are subtracted and one where the terms are added.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the expression <m>a^2 - b^2</m>, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> represent the square roots of the two terms. 
            When you subtract two perfect squares, you can factor the expression as the product of two binomials: 
            <m>(a - b)</m> and <m>(a + b)</m>.
        </p>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the quadratic, solve:
                    <md>
                        <mrow> \amp x^2 - 16</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    In this case, <m>a^2 = x^2</m> and <m>b^2 = 16.</m> The square roots of <m>x^2</m> and <m>16</m> are <m>x</m> and <m>4,</m>
                    respectively. Applying the difference of squares identity we have:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x^2 - 16 \amp = (x - 4)(x + 4) </mrow>

        <p>
            A <em><term>Perfect Square</term></em> is a special kind of trinomial that can be factored into the square of a binomial. 
            There are two forms of perfect square identities:
        </p>
        <sidebyside>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>a^2 + 2ab +b^2 \amp = (a + b)^2 </mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    and
                </me>                
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \amp = (a - b)^2</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
            In these identities, the expression on the left is a perfect square, which means it can be written as the square of a binomial (a two-term expression). 
            The first identity is used when the middle term is positive, and the second identity is used when the middle term is negative.
        </p>

        <example>
        <title>(Using the first identity)</title>
            
            <statement>
                <p>
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the quadratic below:
                    <me>
                        x^2 + 6x + 9
                    </me>                    
                </p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    Here, <m>a^2 = x^2, 2ab = 6x</m> and <m>b^2 = 9.</m> The square roots of <m>x^2</m> and <m>9</m> are <m>x</m> and <m>3,</m>
                     respectively.
                     The middle term <m>2ab</m> is <m>6x,</m> which fits the formula for a perfect square with a negative middle term. 
                     Applying the identity:
                     <md>
                        <mrow>x^2 + 6x + 9 \amp = (x + 3)^2 </mrow>
                     </md>
                     So, <m>x^2 + 6x + 9</m> factors into <m>(x + 3)^2.</m>
                </p>
            </solution>

                    The square roots of <m>x^2</m> and <m>25</m> are <m>x</m> and <m>5</m>, respectively. 
                    The middle term <m>2ab</m> is <m>-10x</m>, which matches the formula for a perfect square trinomial with a negative middle term. 
                    Applying the identity:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x^2 - 10x + 25 \amp = (x - 5)^2 </mrow>
                    </md>
                    So, <m>x^2 - 10x + 25</m> factors into <m>(x - 5)^2.</m>

        <title>Factoring Quadratic.</title>
        <p>
            Factoring quadratic expressions involves expressing a quadratic equation in the form of two binomials. 
            A general quadratic equation looks like:
            <me>
                (ax + m)(bx + n)
            </me>
            To factor a quadratic, we find two numbers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> such that:
            <ol marker="i." cols="2">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>m \times n = ac</m> (the product of <m>a</m> and <m>c</m>),
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>m + n = b</m> (the coefficient of <m>x</m>)
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Once we find <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, we break the middle term <m>bx</m> into two terms using <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, then factor by grouping.

                    Now, factor out the common binomials:
