    <title>Derive The Quadratic Identities From The Concept Of Area</title>

    <p>
        The quadratic identities are derived from the concept of area. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and breadth. The area of a square is given by the square of its side. The area of a rectangle can be expressed as the sum of the areas of two squares. This is the basis of the quadratic identities.
