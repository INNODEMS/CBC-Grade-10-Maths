    <title>Finding reciprocals of real numbers using division</title>
    <p>
     The reciprocal of a real number <m>x</m> is <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>, except when <m>x=0</m> since division by zero is undefined. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example: the reciprocal of <m>2</m> is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
     To find the reciprocal of <m>0.25</m> you first write the number as a fraction :<m>\frac{25}{100}</m>.
     Therefore, the reciprocal of <m>0.25 = \frac{100}{25}</m> which can be simplified to give <m>4</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reciprocal of <m>\frac{3}{5}</m> is <m>\frac{5}{3}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{To find the reciprocal of a real number using division, follow these steps:}</m>

                 Understand the Reciprocal: The reciprocal of a real number <m>x</m> is <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>. 
                 This means that when you multiply a number by its reciprocal, the result is always <m>1</m>:

                    Next, use division to find the reciprocal of a number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: reciprocal of <m>5 = \frac{1}{5}</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using division to find reciprocal of <m>5</m> we have:<m>1 \div 5 = 0.2</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reciprocal of <m>-3</m> is <m>1 div -3 = 0.333...</m> also written as <m>0.\dot{3}</m> to mean it is recurring.
