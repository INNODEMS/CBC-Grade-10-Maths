    Can Mutula arrange the hats in rows where each row has the same number of hats? What does this tell you about the number <m>35</m>?

            <p>
            <term>A prime number</term> is a number that has only two factors, that is, <m>1</m> and itself. Example:<m>2,3,5,7,11,\ldots</m>

        </p>
        <p>
            <term>A factor</term> of a number is a natural number that divides it exactly with no remainder.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, <m>6</m> is not a prime number because it has more than two factors: <m>1, 2, 3,</m> and <m>6</m>. That is, <m>6 = 1 \times 6</m> and <m>6 = 2 \times 3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To identify if a number is prime, check if the number has only two factors: <m>1</m> and itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Composite numbers</term> are natural numbers greater than <m>1</m> that have more than two factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples: <m>4(\text{factors}:\, 1,2,4), 6(\text{factors:} \,1,2,3,6), 9(\text{factors:} \,1,3,9)</m>. Hence <m>4,6</m> and <m>9</m> are composite numbers since they have more than <m>2</m> factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            To identify if a number is composite, check if the number has more than two factors.  In other words, if it can be divided exactly by numbers other than 1 and itself, then it is a composite number.

            Every composite number has prime factors. That is, it can be broken down into a product of prime numbers.

                        Odd composite numbers are odd natural numbers greater than <m>1</m> that are not prime (e.g., <m> 9, 15, 21,...)</m>.
