    <title>Real-world applications of reciprocals of real numbers</title>
    <p>
Reciprocals are essential in various fields, including finance, science, engineering, medicine, and transportation, where they simplify mathematical computations.
In disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and manufacturing, dividing rational numbers using reciprocals helps solve real-world problems, from calculating speed and time to determining chemical concentrations and optimizing production efficiency. 
In this section, we will explore real-world applications of reciprocals and how they make mathematical computations easier and more practical.
