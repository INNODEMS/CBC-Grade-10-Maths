    <title>Real-world applications of reciprocals of real numbers</title>
    <p xml:id="auto_2a080918">
        Reciprocals are important in various fields, including finance, science, engineering, medicine, and transportation .
        In disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and manufacturing, dividing rational numbers using reciprocals helps solve real-world problems, from calculating speed and time to determining chemical concentrations and optimizing production efficiency.

                She needs to determine how many full batches she can make.

        Here are practical examples of how reciprocals are applied to solve real-world problems:

       1. A printing machine can print <m>\frac{5}{6}</m> of a book page per second. 
        How long will it take to print <m>20</m> pages?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_dbn73pzj">
        If <m>1</m> second = <m>\frac{5}{6}</m> of a page, then for <m>20</m> pages, we calculate as follows:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_2wvx0mp0">
        <md>
            <mrow> \text{ Time } =\amp 20 \div \frac{5}{6}</mrow> 
            <mrow>=\amp 20 \times \frac{6}{5}</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_f6gywito">
        Multiplying and simplifying we have: Time = <m>\frac{120}{5} = 24</m> seconds.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_x9ppdgc4">
        Thus, the printing machines will take <m>24</m> seconds to print <m>20</m> pages.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_dja2tely">
        2. If a car travels at <m>80</m> km/h, to find out the time taken per km we can use reciprocal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_hllv22uc">
        Time per km = <m>\frac{1}{80}</m> hours per km.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_2xikxppa">
        3. If a factory produces <m>300</m> items in <m>5</m> hours, then the production rate per hour is:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_bi2500y4">
        <m>\frac{300}{5} = 60</m> items per hour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_aqk1yrt7">
        To determine how much time is needed per item, we use reciprocal:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="auto_7c9qpc54">
       Hence, the factory produces <m>1</m> item every <m>\frac{1}{60}</m> hours.

        <solution>
            <p xml:id="auto_13n3ny6k">
                To find speed we divide distance by time such that: speed = <m>\frac{\text{ distance}}{\text{ time}}</m>.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="auto_9ebh43tr">
                First, we need to convert the fraction <m>3\frac{1}{4}</m> into an improper fraction which is <m>\frac{13}{4}</m>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="auto_1d5vf80j">
               Hence,  speed = <m>3\frac{1}{4} \div \frac{1}{2} = \frac{13}{4} \div \frac{1}{2}</m>
            </p>
            <p xml:id="auto_ax0ic8k9">
                Multiply <m>\frac{13}{4}</m> by the reciprocal of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.

            <p xml:id="auto_lasjesn8">
                 <m>\frac{13}{4} \times \frac{2}{1} = \frac{26}{4}</m>

            <p xml:id="auto_u4qmy5x3">

          To determine whether the sample meets the manufacturer's claim, first calculate the area it covers.
