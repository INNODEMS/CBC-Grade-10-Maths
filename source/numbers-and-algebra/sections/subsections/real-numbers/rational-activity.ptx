                            Working in groups, choose any set of natural numbers between <m>1</m> and <m>10</m> (e.g., <m>2, 3, 5,7,..</m>)

                        <p>
                            One proper fraction (e.g., <m>3/5</m>)

                        <p>
                            One improper fraction (e.g., <m>7/4</m>)

                            Write down the decimal value of each.

                            Example: <m>\sqrt{9}= 3</m>(a rational number),<m>\sqrt{2} = 1.414...</m>(an irrational number).

                            Classify each number you have created (fractions, decimals, and square roots) as either rational or irrational.

                            What do you notice about the decimal form of rational numbers compared to irrational numbers?
