        <m>\textbf{ Key Takeaway}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\bullet</m> <m>\textbf{ Rational number} (\mathbb{Q}):</m> A rational number is any number that can be written as a fraction <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are integers and <m>q \neq 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: <m>\frac{2}{3},-3,4 </m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\bullet</m>  <m>\textbf{ Irrational number:}</m> An irrational number is any number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two intergers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: <m>\sqrt{7}, \sqrt{2}, \pi</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\bullet</m>  <m>\textbf{Integers}</m> consists of positive whole numbers, negative whole numbers and <m>0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> The decimal representation of a rational number either terminates (stops at some point) or repeats (continues but has a repeating pattern).
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: <m>0.375, 3.45454545...</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> The decimal representation of an irrational number neither terminates (does not stop) nor repeats (continues without a repeated pattern).
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: <m> 3.14285714..., 4.298103993...</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> The square root of a perfect square is a rational number.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: <m>\sqrt{16} = 4</m> and <m>4</m> can be written as <m>\frac{4}{1}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
       <m>\bullet</m> The square root of an imperfect square is an irrational number. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: <m>\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237</m> which is an irrational number.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{ How to determine if a number is rational or irrational.}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Rule: Check if the number is an integer or a fraction with an integer as the numerator and the denominator. If it is, then it is a rational number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: <m>7</m> or <m>\frac{4}{5}</m> are both rational numbers because they are either whole numbers or simple fractions. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Rule: "If the number is in decimal form, check if the decimal stops at some point. If it stops then the number is a rational number." 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: <m>3.25</m> is rational because the decimal terminates.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Rule: If the number is in decimal form, check if the decimal continues. If it continues with a repeated pattern then the number is a rational number and if it continues without a pattern then it is irrational. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example (rational): <m>0.666… </m>(repeating)
                </p>
                <p>
                    xample (irrational): <m>0.1010010001… </m>(no pattern)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Rule: "If the number is expressed as a square root, find the square root of the number first and identify if it is a perfect or an imperfect square.
                     If it is a perfect square (results to a whole number) then it is rational and if it is an imperfect square, then it is irrational.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example (rational): <m> \sqrt{49} = 7</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    xample (irrational): <m> \sqrt{2} ≈ 1.414213...</m>

                        Since <m>\pi</m> is defined as <m>3.1415926</m>.

                       We check if the decimal continues.

                    <p>
                      Hence <m>\pi</m> is irrational because its decimal continues without having a repeated pattern.

                        A rational number can have a terminating decimal or a repeating decimal. In this case, the decimal terminates, so the number is rational

               Joy is designing a square garden. She measures the total area of the garden to be <m>50</m> square meters and wants to find the length of one side. 
               What is the exact length of one side of the garden?
               Classify the answer as a rational or irrational number.

            </p>
            <p>
               To find the length of one side of the square, we take the square root of its area.

            <p>
                Simplifying the side length <m>\sqrt{50} = \sqrt{(25 \times 5)} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2} = 5 \sqrt{2}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <m>\sqrt{2}</m> an irrational number, multiplying it by <m>5</m> still gives an irrational number.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the exact length of one side of the garden is <m>5 \sqrt{2}</m> meters, which is an irrational number.
