    <title>Using reciprocals of real numbers in mathematical computations</title>
    <p>
        This is application of the concept of reciprocals to perform different types of mathematical operations such as division, solving equations, proportions, rates, and real-life problem-solving.

                In groups, find an exercise book and a pen.
            </p>
            <p>
               1. Write different numbers (that is positive, negative, decimal numbers and fractions) on the exercise book.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: <m>2, -4,0.25,\frac{5}{8}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Find the reciprocals of the numbers you have formed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: Number formed is <m>\frac{5}{8}</m> its reciprocal is given by <m>1 \div \frac{5}{8} = 1 \times \frac{8}{5} = \frac{8}{5}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Multiply the original number you formed by its corresponding reciprocal and observe the result.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: <m>\frac{5}{8} \times \frac{8}{5}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Discuss cases where reciprocals do not exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Identify a real world problem where reciprocals are useful.

            <p>
                6. Share your work with fellow learners.

                <p>
                    Instead of dividing a number, we multiply by the reciprocal: <m>a \div b = a \times \frac{1}{b}</m>.

                    Solving Equations
                </p>
                <p>
                   When solving equations where a variable is multiplied by a number, we use the reciprocal to isolate the variable.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Solve for <m>x</m> in the equation <m>3x = 12</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To solve for <m>x</m>, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of <m>3</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, <m>x = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4</m>

                <p>
                1. A printing machine can print <m>\frac{5}{6}</m> of a book page per second. 
                    How long will it take to print <m>20</m> pages?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If <m>1</m> second = <m>\frac{5}{6}</m> of a page, then for <m>20</m> pages, we calculate as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <md>
                        <mrow> \text{ Time } =\amp 20 \div \frac{5}{6}</mrow> 
                        <mrow>=\amp 20 \times \frac{6}{5}</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiplying and simplifying we have: Time = <m>\frac{120}{5} = 24</m> seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, the printing machines will take <m>24</m> seconds to print <m>20</m> pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. If a car travels at <m>80</m> km/h, to find out the time taken per km we can use reciprocal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time per km = <m>\frac{1}{80}</m> hours per km.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. If a factory produces <m>300</m> items in <m>5</m> hours, then the production rate per hour is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m>\frac{300}{5} = 60</m> items per hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To determine how much time is needed per item, we use reciprocal:
                </p>
                <p>
                Hence, the factory produces <m>1</m> item every <m>\frac{1}{60}</m> hours.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Kerich is a farmer and has <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of an acre of land and wants to divide it into plots of <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> acre each. How many plots can Kerich make?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
              To find the number of plots that Kerich can make, we solve it as a division problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Divide <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> by <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> and solve it by multiplying <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> by the reciprocal of <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> as below:
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow> \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6}=\amp \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1}</mrow>
                    <mrow> \frac{12}{3}=\amp 4 </mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence Kerich can make <m>4</m> plots.
            </p>
        </solution>

                Njoki, a business woman invest ksh <m>5\,000</m> in a business that promises to double his investment every <m>1.5</m> years.
                What fraction of her initial investment will she have after <m>4.5</m> years?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                If <m>1.5</m> years <m>= 2</m> times the initial investment, how about <m>4.5</m> years?
            </p>
            <p>
                Computing the number of times her investment will yield after <m>4.5</m> years we have: <m>4.5 \div 1.5</m> 
            </p>
            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow> = \amp 4.5 \times \frac{1}{1.5}</mrow>
                    <mrow> = \amp 3</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
            <p>
              This means her investment will double <m>3</m> times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, after <m>4.5</m> years her investment will be <m>5000 \times 2\times2\times2</m>
            </p>
            <p>

               Representing the number of years with their corresponding double investment in ksh makes it easier to understand the above computations.

              Okoth runs <m>3 \frac{1}{4}</m>  miles in <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> an hour. What is her speed in miles per hour?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                To find speed we divide distance by time such that: speed = <m>\frac{\text{ distance}}{\text{ time}}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we need to convert the fraction <m>3\frac{1}{4}</m> into an improper fraction which is <m>\frac{13}{4}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
               Hence,  speed = <m>3\frac{1}{4} \div \frac{1}{2} = \frac{13}{4} \div \frac{1}{2}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiply <m>\frac{13}{4}</m> by the reciprocal of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                 <m>\frac{13}{4} \times \frac{2}{1} = \frac{26}{4}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Simplifying <m>\frac{26}{4}</m> we get <m>\frac{13}{2}</m> which is <m>= 6 \frac{1}{2}</m>.
