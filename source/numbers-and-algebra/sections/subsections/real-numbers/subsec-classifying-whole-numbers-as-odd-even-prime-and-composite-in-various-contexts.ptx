    <title>Classifying whole numbers as odd, even, prime and composite in different situations</title>
    <p>
        Whole numbers can be classified as odd, even, prime or composite based on their divisibility and factor properties.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Kirui has 35 cows on his farm and wants to group them into 2 pens. Will each pen have an equal number of cows? Explain using properties of even and odd numbers.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First we identify whether <m>35</m> is even or odd.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the last digit is <m>5</m>, this makes <m>35</m> is an odd number.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since an odd number cannot be divided evenly into equal groups, the cows can only be divided into two groups: one with <m>18</m> cows and the other with <m>17</m> cows. 
                Therefore, the cows cannot be shared evenly across all pens.

        <term>A prime number</term> is a number that has only two factors, that is, <m>1</m> and itself. Example:<m>2,3,5,7,11,...</m>

    </p>
    <p>
        <term>A factor</term> of a number is a natural number that divides it exactly with no remainder.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, <m>6</m> is not a prime number because it has more than two factors: <m>1, 2, 3,</m> and <m>6</m>. That is, <m>6 = 1 \times 6</m> and <m>6 = 2 \times 3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To identify if a number is prime, check if the number has only two factors: <m>1</m> and itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Composite numbers</term> are natural numbers greater than <m>1</m> that have more than two factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples: <m>4(\text{factors}:\, 1,2,4), 6(\text{factors:} \,1,2,3,6), 9(\text{factors:} \,1,3,9)</m>. Hence <m>4,6</m> and <m>9</m> are composite numbers since they have more than <m>2</m> factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        To identify if a number is composite, check if the number has more than two factors.  In other words, if it can be divided exactly by numbers other than 1 and itself, then it is a composite number.

        Every composite number has prime factors. That is, it can be broken down into a product of prime numbers.
