    <title>Classifying whole numbers as odd, even, prime and composite in various contexts</title>
    <p>
      <m>\textbf{Even numbers}</m> are numbers that are divisible by <m>2</m>.The digits in the ones place value are <m>0,2,4,6 </m> or <m> 8 </m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Odd numbers}</m> are numbers that when divided by two, it leaves a remainder. 
        The digit in the ones place value of an odd number is <m>1,3,5,7</m> or <m>9</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{A prime number}</m> is a number that has only two divisors, that is, <m>1</m> and the number itself.Example:<m>2,3,5,7,11,...</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Composite numbers}</m> are whole numbers that are greater than <m>1</m> and has more than two factors. Examples:<m>4, 6, 8, ...</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{NOTE} 0 </m> and <m>1</m>  are neither prime nor composite.
