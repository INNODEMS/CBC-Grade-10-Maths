    <title>Classifying whole numbers as odd, even, prime and composite in different situations</title>
    <p>
        Whole numbers can be classified as odd, even, prime or composite based on their divisibility and factor properties.

                Kirui  has <m>35</m> cows in his farm and wants to group them equally into <m>2</m> pens. Will each pen have an equal number of cows? Explain using even and odd number properties.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First we identify whether <m>35</m> is even or odd.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the last digit is <m>5</m>, this makes <m>35</m> is an odd number.
            </p>
            <p>
                An odd number cannot be divided evenly into equal groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best we can do in this case is to divide the cows into two groups: one with <m>18</m> cows and the other <m>17</m> cows. This means it's not possible to split the cows evenly across all pens.

        For example, <m>6</m> is not a prime number because it has more than two factors: <m>1, 2, 3,</m> and <m>6</m>. That is, <m>6 = 1 \times 6</m> and <m>6 = 2 \times 3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To identify if a number is prime, check if the number has two factors: <m>1</m> and itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Composite numbers}</m> are natural numbers greater than <m>1</m> that have more than two factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples: <m>4(\text{factors}:\, 1,2,4), 6(\text{factors:} \,1,2,3,6), 9(\text{factors:} \,1,3,9)</m>. Hence <m>4,6</m> and <m>9</m> are composite numbers since they have more than <m>2</m> factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        To identify if a number is composite, check if the number has more than two factors.  In other words, if it can be divided exactly by numbers other than 1 and itself, then it is a composite number.

        Every composite number has prime factors. That is, it can be broken down into a product of prime numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        This helps reinforce the idea of prime factorization, which is a key property of composite numbers.
