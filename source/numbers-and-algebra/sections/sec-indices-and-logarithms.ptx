    <title>Indices and Logarithms</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Mathematics involves working with very large and very small numbers, which can be simplified using indices. An <m>index</m> (plural <m>indices</m>) also called <m>exponent</m> or <m>power</m> is a way of writing repeated multiplication of the same number.

            Indices are widely used in:

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Scientific notation writing, where numbers are sometimes very large and sometimes very small, such as the speed of light or the size of an atom.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Physics and Engineering to understand exponential growth and decay rates, such as radioactive decay and population growth.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Finance and money in calculating compound interest.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
