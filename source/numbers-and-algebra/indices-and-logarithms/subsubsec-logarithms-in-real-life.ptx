    <example xml:id="ex-population-growth">
        <statement>
            <p>A country's population grows by 5% each year. So if the initial population is <m>P_0</m>, then after <m>t</m> years the population is <m>P=P_0 (1.05)^{t}</m>. How long does it take for the population to double?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>For doubling <m>2P_0=P_0 e^{rt}</m> so <m>2=e^{rt}</m> giving <m>\ln 2 = rt</m> and <m>t=\frac{\ln2}{0.05}\approx 13.86\text{ years}</m>. (At 5% the doubling time is <m>\approx 14</m> years; to double in 10 years <m>r\approx6.93\%</m>.)</p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-carbon-dating">
        <title>Carbon Dating and Half-Life</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Carbon-14 dating is a method for estimating the age of formerly living things. While alive, organisms take in Carbon-14; after death the Carbon-14 decays and is not replaced, so the remaining fraction indicates how long it has been since death.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the amount of carbon at the beginning is <m>N_0</m>, after <m>t</m> years the amount remaining is <m>N = N_0\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{t/T_{1/2}}</m>, where <m>T_{1/2}</m> is the half-life. For Carbon-14, <m>T_{1/2}=5730</m> years. In other words, every <m>T_{1/2}=5730</m> years the amount of Carbon-14 in the sample decreases by one half.
            </p>
            <p>
                A sample of human bones contains 12.5% of the amount of Carbon-14 in the bones of a living human being. Estimate the age of the sample.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                As 12.5% remain, we have <m>N=0.125N_0</m>. Using the decay formula, we get <m>0.125N_0=N_0\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{t/5730}</m>. Dividing by <m>N_0</m>, we have <m>0.125=\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{t/5730}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                Take log with base 2 on both sides: <m>\log_2 0.125=\tfrac{t}{5730}\log_2(1/2)</m>, so
                <m>t=5730\dfrac{\log_2 0.125}{\log_2 (1/2)}</m>. Since <m>\log_2 0.125=-3</m> and <m>\log_2 (1/2)=-1</m>, we get <m>t=5730\times3=17190</m> years.

        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>pH = -\log(3.2\times 10^{-4}) = -(\log 3.2 + \log 10^{-4}) = -(0.5051 - 4) = 3.49 (acidic solution)</p>

        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>Here <m>I/I_0 = 1000 = 10^3</m>, so <m>R = \log 10^3 = 3</m>. Magnitude = 3.0.</p>

                    You put 10000 ksh into an account that grows by 6% each year. How many years will it take for the money to double to 20000 ksh if the interest is added once per year?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each year, the new amount <m>A</m> of money is the old amount <m>P + 0.06 P = P(1 + 0.06) = P(1.06)</m>. So after <m>t</m> years, <m>A = P(1.06)^t</m>. Put <m>A=20000</m>, <m>P=10000</m>. So
                    <m>20000 = 10000(1.06)^t</m> which simplifies to <m>2 = 1.06^t</m>.
                    Take natural logs of both sides: <m>\ln 2 = t\ln 1.06</m>, therefore
                    <m>t = \dfrac{\ln 2}{\ln 1.06} \approx \dfrac{0.6931}{0.05827} \approx 11.9\ \text{years}.</m>
