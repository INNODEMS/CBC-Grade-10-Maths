    <title>Numbers and Algebra</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Numbers are the foundation of mathematics, serving as tools to count, measure, and describe quantities. 
            They form the basis for understanding the world around us, from simple arithmetic to complex calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this chapter, we delve into the interplay between numbers and algebra, exploring real numbers, indices, logarithms, and quadratic expressions. 
            These concepts are essential for solving equations, analyzing patterns, and developing a deeper understanding of mathematical relationships.
