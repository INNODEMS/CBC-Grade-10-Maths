    <title>Quadratic Expressions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            A quadratic expression is an algebraic expression in which the highest power of the variable is <m>2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It can be written in the form:
            <me>
                ax^2 + bx + c
            </me>
        </p>

        <p>
            where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are real numbers and <m>a \neq 0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The term <m>ax^2</m> is called the quadratic term, 
            <m>bx</m> the linear term, 
            and <m>c</m> the constant term.
        </p>

        <p>
            Quadratic expressions are commonly formed by multiplying two linear expressions.
