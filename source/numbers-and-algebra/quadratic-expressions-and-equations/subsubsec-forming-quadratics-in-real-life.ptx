    <title>Forming Quadratics in Real-Life</title>

    <p>
        Quadratic expressions often arise when working with area and geometric situations.
    </p>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A rectangular garden has a length of <m>(x + 4)</m> metres and a width of <m>(x + 1)</m> metres.
                <ol marker="a)">
                    <li>Form an expression for the area of the garden.</li>
                    <li>Write the expression in standard form.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Area of a rectangle:
                <me>
                    \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
                </me>
            </p>

            <p>
                Substitute the given expressions:
                <me>
                    (x + 4)(x + 1)
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Expand:
                <me>
                    x^2 + x + 4x + 4
                </me>
                <me>
                    = x^2 + 5x + 4
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                The area is expressed as a quadratic expression.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The product of two consecutive integers is formed.
                <ol marker="a)">
                    <li>Represent the integers algebraically.</li>
                    <li>Form the expression for their product.</li>
                    <li>Write the result in standard form.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Let the first integer be <m>x</m>.
                The next consecutive integer is <m>x + 1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their product:
                <me>
                    x(x + 1)
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Expand:
                <me>
                    x^2 + x
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a quadratic expression.
            </p>
        </solution>
