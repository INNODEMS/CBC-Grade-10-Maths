                The local government plans to introduce a new school bus stop along a straight road near your school. 
                Before approval, the transport committee needs to determine whether the stopping distance is safe for learners crossing the road.

            <p>
                You are part of a team of student consultants tasked with analysing the motion of a school bus using principles of linear motion.

                Your team is given the following data:

        <p>
            Linear motion principles are fundamental in transportation safety.
        </p>
        <p>
             Understanding stopping distances helps engineers and planners design safer roads and establish appropriate speed limits in different zones. 
        </p>
        <p>
             The relationship between speed, reaction time, and braking distance directly impacts pedestrian safety and accident prevention.
        </p>
        <p>
           Engineers apply motion calculations when designing vehicles, elevators, and transport systems to ensure safety and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            In sports, motion analysis improves performance by evaluating speed, acceleration, and timing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Industries use constant motion principles to control machines and production systems.

                            Greater acceleration allows an athlete to reach a higher speed in a shorter time. 
                            This provides a competitive advantage, especially at the start of a race.
