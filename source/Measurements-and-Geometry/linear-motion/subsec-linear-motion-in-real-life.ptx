                The local government plans to introduce a new school bus stop along a straight road near your school. 
                Before approval, the transport committee needs to determine whether the stopping distance is safe for learners crossing the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are part of a team of student consultants tasked with analysing the motion of a school bus using principles of linear motion.

            <p>
                Your team is given the following data:

                            After reacting, the bus decelerates uniformly at <m>4</m> m/s<m>^2</m> until it stops.
