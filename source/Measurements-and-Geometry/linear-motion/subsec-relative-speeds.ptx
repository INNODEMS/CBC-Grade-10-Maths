            <term>Relative speed</term> is a simple concept that helps us 
            understand how fast one object is moving compared to another object. 
            It's important because sometimes objects are moving at different speeds, 
            and we need to figure out how quickly they are closing the gap between 
            them or moving away from each other.

            Consider a case where two bodies moving in the same direction at different speeds. 
            Their <term>relative speed</term> is the difference between the individual speeds.
        </p>

            But if they are moving toward each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.
