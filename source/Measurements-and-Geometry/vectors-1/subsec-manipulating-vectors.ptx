    <title>Manipulating Vectors</title>
    <introduction>
          <p>
             Manipulating vectors involves performing operations such as addition, scalar multiplication, and translation. 
             These operations allow us to combine and transform vectors in various ways.
             Some of the key methods for manipulating vectors are graphical addition and subtraction,
              algebraic addition and subtraction, scalar multiplication, and translation.
