    <title>Reflection and Congruence</title>
    <!-- <introduction>
    <p>
       Reflection and congruence are two powerful concepts that shape much of what we see and do around us. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflection is a geometrical transformation whereby an object is flipped across a line of reflection to create a mirror image.
       Reflection is all about symmetry, that is, the similarity in shape and size when an object is cut, flipped or folded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congruence means there is similarity in shape and size of an object or figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a wide range of application of reflection and congruence in real life. For instance:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Reflection is used in science and medicine to create medical images like ultrasounds, of internal body organs. 
            The reflection of sound waves helps create images of internal organs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Tailors use the concept of congruence in designing clothes. This is because  patterns for clothing rely on congruent pieces for proper fitting and symmetry.
            For instance when you look at the arms a t-shirt or sweater, you will notice the similarity in size and shape (congruence).

      </ul>
