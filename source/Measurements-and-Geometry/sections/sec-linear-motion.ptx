    <title>Linear Motion</title>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Linear motion}</m> refers to the movement of an object in a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is described using key concepts such as distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Linear motion} </m> is present in many real-world scenarios:

            <li>
                <p>
                    Vehicles -  Cars accelerating, stopping, and moving at constant speed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Sports - Running, cycling, and swimming events involve linear motion.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Free Fall - Objects falling under gravity move in linear motion.
