    <p>
        Linear motion is present in many real-world scenarios:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol marker="i.">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Vehicles -  Cars accelerating, stopping, and moving at constant speed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Sports - Running, cycling, and swimming events involve linear motion.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Free Fall - Objects falling under gravity move in linear motion.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <m>\textbf{distance}</m> between two points is the length of the path joining them. The SI unit of distance is <m>\textbf{metre}</m> .
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Displacement}</m> - Distance in a specified direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Speed}</m> - The rate of change of distance with time. SI unit: <m>km/h</m> .
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Velocity}</m> - Speed in a specified direction or the rate of change of displacement with time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Acceleration}</m> - The rate of change of velocity with time. SI unit: <m>m/sÂ²</m>.
    </p>
