        The distance between two points is the length of the path joining them. The SI unit of distance is the metre.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Displacement}</m> - Distance in a specified direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Speed}</m> - The rate of change of distance with time. SI unit: <m>km/h</m> .
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Velocity}</m> - Speed in a specified direction or the rate of change of displacement with time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Acceleration}</m> - The rate of change of velocity with time. SI unit: <m>m/sÂ²</m>.

        Linear motion is present in many real-world scenarios:
