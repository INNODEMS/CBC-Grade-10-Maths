    <title>Area of Polygons</title>
    <introduction>

        The area of a polygon refers to the amount of space enclosed within its boundaries. It is measured in square units (e.g., cmÂ², mÂ², inÂ²).
        Why is Area Important? Would you wish to pursue a career some day? Have you ever seen an Architect? So finding area is Essential in design and architecture as well as construction of houses for it helps to determine the spacing of rooms in a house in relation to the effect desired.

         A <m>\textbf{polygon}</m> is a closed two dimension shape with straight sides. Examples include triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, heptagons,octagons, nenagons and decagons. <m> \textbf{Their sides do not curve or overlap.}</m>

                    We have different types of polygons but we are going to focus on only two in this chapter Regular polygons and irregular polygons.

                <p>
                    ðŸ”¹ Regular polygons â€“ All sides and angles are equal (e.g., square, equilateral triangle).
                </p>
                <p>
                   ðŸ”¹ Irregular polygons â€“ Sides and angles are not equal (e.g., a scalene triangle, a random quadrilateral).
                </p>
                <p>
                    ðŸ”¹ Convex polygons â€“ All interior angles are less than 180Â°.
                </p>
                <p>
                   ðŸ”¹  Concave polygons â€“ At least one interior angle is greater than 180Â°.
