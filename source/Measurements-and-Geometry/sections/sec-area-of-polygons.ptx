    <title>Area of Polygons</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Why polygons?}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <m>\textbf{area of a polygon }</m>refers to the amount of space enclosed within its boundaries. It is measured in square units e.g., cmÂ², mÂ², inÂ² etc.
       </p>
       <p>
            Why is Area Important?</p>
       
        <p> 
           Would you wish to pursue a career some day? Have you ever seen an Architect? </p>
           <p>So finding area is Essential in design and architecture as well as construction of houses for it helps to determine the spacing of rooms in a house in relation to the effect desired.

         â™¦ A <m>\textbf{polygon}</m> is a closed two dimension formed by straight lines that connect end to end at a point called a <m>\textbf{vertex}</m>. Examples of polygons include triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, heptagons,octagons, nonagons and decagons. <m> \textbf{Their sides do not curve or overlap.}</m>

                  Note that most of the interior angles of a polygon are smaller than exterior angles.

                    We have different types of polygons but we are going to focus on only two in this chapter Regular polygons and irregular polygons.

                <p>
                    ðŸ”¹ Regular polygons â€“ All sides and angles are equal (e.g., square, equilateral triangle).
                </p>
                <p>
                   ðŸ”¹ Irregular polygons â€“ Sides and angles are not equal (e.g., a scalene triangle, a random quadrilateral).
                </p>
                <p>
                    ðŸ”¹ Convex polygons â€“ All interior angles are less than 180Â°.
                </p>
                <p>
                   ðŸ”¹  Concave polygons â€“ At least one interior angle is greater than 180Â°.
