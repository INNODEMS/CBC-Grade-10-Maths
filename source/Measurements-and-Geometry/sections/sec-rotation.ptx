    <title>Rotation</title>

    <p>
        Rotation is a transformation that moves an object around a fixed point  but its size and shape are not changed.
        Rotations are sometimes called turns.
        The point around which a rotation occurs is called the centre of rotation, and the distance a shape turns is called the angle of rotation
        Examples of rotations include the minute needle of a clock, merry-go-round, e.t.c.

        In this section, We will learn about rotations about a point, including how to describe rotations.
