                    Have you ever watched the hands of a clock move, seen a merry-go-round spin, or noticed the Earth turning? These all involve rotation—the spinning of an object around a fixed point or axis. Rotation is everywhere!

                    When you ride a merry-go-round or ride a bicycle, the wheels rotate, making everything move smoothly. The Earth itself rotates, which gives us day and night. Even when you stir your drink, you're creating a small rotation!

                    Rotation is a transformation that moves an object around a fixed point  but its size and shape are not changed.
                    Rotations are sometimes called turns.
                    The point around which a rotation occurs is called the centre of rotation, and the distance a shape turns is called the angle of rotation

                    In this lesson, we will explore the beauty of rotation, understand its principles, and see how it plays a role in everything.
