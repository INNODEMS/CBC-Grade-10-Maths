    <title>Surface Area </title>
    <p>
        Surface area is the total area of the exposed or outer surfaces of a prism.
    </p>
    <p>
        🔹A right prism is a geometric solid that has a polygon as its base and vertical faces perpendicular to the base.
        The base and top surface are the same shape and size. It is called a “right” prism because the angles between
        the base and faces are right angles.
    </p>
    <p>
        🔹 The name given to the solid that is unfolded like this is called a net. When a prism is unfolded into a net, we can clearly see each of its faces. 
    </p>
    <p>
        🔹 We can thereby clearly calculate the surface area by finding the area of each faces and add them all together to get the surface area of the Prism.
    </p>
    <p>
       🔹 For example, If we are given a cylinder, the top and bottom faces are circles and the curved area is like a rectangle. So when finding it's surface area we find the area of the two circles and the area of the rectangle then we dd all these areas al together to compute yhe cylinder's surface area.
