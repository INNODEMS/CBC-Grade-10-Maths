    <title>Area of a Part of a Circle</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In Grade 8, you learned how to find the area and arc length of a sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, youâ€™ll go a step further and discover how to find the area of different parts of a circle.
        </p>
        <p>
            This includes:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        the area of an annulus (a ring shape),
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        the area of a sector,
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        the area of an annular sector (a slice of a ring),
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        and the area where circles overlap.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
