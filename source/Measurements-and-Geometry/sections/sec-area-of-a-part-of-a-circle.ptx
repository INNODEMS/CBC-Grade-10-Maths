    <title>Area of a Part of a Circle</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In Grade 8, you learned how to find the area and arc length of a sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this section, you will explore more about the area of different parts of a circle.
            This includes the area of an annulus, the area of a sector, the area of an annular sector,
            and the area of intersecting circles. By the end, you will understand how to apply 
            these concepts to real-life situations.
