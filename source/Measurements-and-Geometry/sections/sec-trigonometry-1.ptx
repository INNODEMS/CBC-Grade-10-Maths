    <introduction>
        <p>
         <term>In Grade 10 Trigonometry 1, we will learn about trigonometric ratiosâ€”sine, cosine,
          and tangent and use them to solve problems involving right-angled triangles. we will apply the Pythagorean theorem and use special
          angle values to find unknown sides or angles in a triangle. These concepts  will help in real-world applications, such as measuring the height 
          of a building and many more.</term>

                <term>Trigonometry</term> is a branch of mathematics that studies the 
                relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. It is primarily concerned with 
                right-angled triangles and uses trigonometric functions such as <m>\sin</m> (sine),
                <m>\cos</m> (cosine), and <m>\tan</m> (tangent) to describe these relationships.
            </p>

            

            <p>Right-angled triangles can be found in various real-life structures and objects. Some examples include:</p>

            
                
            <p><term>Staircases:</term> A staircase forms a right-angled triangle with the vertical wall (height), 
            the horizontal floor (base), and the slanted stairs (hypotenuse).</p>
            
            
            <p><term>Roof Structures:</term> The triangular sections of a gable roof 
            create right-angled triangles where the vertical rise meets the base of the roof.</p>
        
        
            <p><term>Ladders Against a Wall:</term> A ladder leaning against a wall 
            forms a right-angled triangle with the ground and the wall.</p>
        
        
            <p><term>Bridges and Ramps:</term> Ramps for wheelchairs or inclined 
            roads often create right-angled triangles.</p>
        
        
            <p><term>Tree Shadows:</term> The height of a tree, its shadow, and the line 
            from the top of the tree to the tip of the shadow form a right-angled triangle.</p>
