    <title>Vectors I</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            <alert>Vectors</alert> are an essential concept in mathematics that extend beyond just numbers. 
            Suppose I ask you, "How far is your home from school?" You might respond with "<m>2</m> kilometers."
            However, this information alone is not enough for me to get to your home. 
            To reach your destination, I would also need to know the direction, 
            whether it is east, west, northeast, or south. 
            This combination of both distance and direction is what a vector represents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pilots rely on vectors to determine the direction and distance 
            they need to travel from one location to another. 
            In this topic, we will explore how to use vectors and perform various operations on them.
