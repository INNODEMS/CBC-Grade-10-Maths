    <title>Volume of Composite solids</title>

    <p>
       A composite solid is a three-dimensional shape made up of two or more simple solids (such as cubes, cylinders, cones, spheres, prisms, and pyramids). To find the volume of a composite solid, the volumes of the individual solids are calculated and then either added or subtracted, depending on the situation.
