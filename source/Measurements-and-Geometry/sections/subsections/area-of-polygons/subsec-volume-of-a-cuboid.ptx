        1. A cuboid has a volume of 600 cmÂ³, a length of 10 cm, and a width of 5 cm.
       Find its height.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. A rectangular water tank has a base of 2 m by 3 m and a height of 4 m.
      How many liters of water can it hold when full?
    </p>
    <p>
        3. A shipping company uses boxes shaped like cuboids. Each box has a length of 40 cm, width of 30 cm, and height of 20 cm.
        If a warehouse has a storage space of 12 mÂ³,
        how many such boxes can fit in the warehouse?
    </p>
    <p>
        4.If the length, width, and height of a cuboid are all doubled,
        by what factor does the volume increase?
    </p>
    <p>
        5. A brick has dimensions 20 cm by 10 cm by 5 cm.
        A wall is built using 500 such bricks, with no gaps between them.
        Find the total volume of bricks used in constructing the wall.
