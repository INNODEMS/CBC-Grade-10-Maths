    <introduction>
        <p>
            Regardless of shape, all polygons are made up of the same parts, sides, vertices, interior angles and exterior angles which may varry in size thus describing why we have irregular polygons versus regular polygons.

        <title>Irregular Heptagon</title>
        <p>
            An irregular polgon has a set of atleast two sides or angles that are not the same. This heptagon has many different size angles , making it irregular.
