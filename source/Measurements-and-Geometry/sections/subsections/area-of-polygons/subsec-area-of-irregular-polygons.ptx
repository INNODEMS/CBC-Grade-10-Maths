                            work with a printed or drawn irregular polygon. The task is to divide the irregular polygon into smaller shapes whose areas are easier to calculate (like triangles, rectangles, or trapeziums).

                            Tip: Use straight lines to cut along the diagonals or through the middle of the shape to create triangles or rectangles.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                                For each smaller shape, ask students to measure the necessary dimensions:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For triangles, they need the base and height.
                        </p>
                            <p>

                            For rectangles, they need the length and width.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For trapeziums, they need the lengths of the two parallel sides and the height.

                            Calculate the Area of Each Shape: Once the polygon is broken into smaller shapes, students can calculate the area of each shape using appropriate formulas

                                Once the area of each smaller shape has been calculated, students should add up all the areas to find the total area of the original irregular polygo

        <p>
            Regardless of shape, all polygons are made up of the same parts, sides, vertices, interior angles and exterior angles which may varry in size thus describing why we have irregular polygons versus regular polygons. 
        </p>
        
   
          <p>
            An irregular polgon has a set of atleast two sides or angles that are not the same. This heptagon has many different size angles , making it irregular.
        </p>
       

    <p>
        The interior angles of an irregular nenagon (9 sides) add up to <m>1,260^\circ</m>. 
        Because angles are different sizes, individual angles cannot be found the sum of the interior angle.
