    <title>Application of Similarity and Enlargement</title>
    <p>
        Similarity and enlargement are used in many areas of mathematics and science. For example, in geometry, similarity and enlargement are used to find the dimensions of similar shapes. In physics, similarity and enlargement are used to find the dimensions of objects that are too small or too large to measure directly. In biology, similarity and enlargement are used to study the growth of plants and animals. In chemistry, similarity and enlargement are used to study the structure of molecules. In computer science, similarity and enlargement are used to create computer graphics.
