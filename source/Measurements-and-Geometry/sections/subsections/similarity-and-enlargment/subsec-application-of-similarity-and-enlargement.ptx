    <!-- <p xml:id="auto_bkqgbnw8">
        Similarity and enlargement are key concepts in geometry, particularly when it comes to shapes, figures, and their properties. Here are some practical applications of these concepts:
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_4kjwge2i">
        (i)<m>\textbf{Architecture and design:}</m>
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_agu6zwrl">
         In architecture, architects often use enlargement and similarity to create scale models of buildings, bridges, or other structures. By maintaining the same proportions but adjusting the size, architects can test designs or present ideas in a more manageable form.
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_nakh8y7b">
        Similarity is used to create blueprints for large structures. These blueprints are scaled-down versions of the final building, preserving the ratio of dimensions in the original structure.
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_e56k2gkl">
        Suppose an architect is designing a scale model of a building. The actual building is <m>150\, m</m> tall, and the architect creates a scale model where the height of the model is <m>0.75\, m</m>.To find the scale factor, use the formula for similarity:
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_w26mvt07">
        scale factor <m>=\frac{\text{Height of model}}{\text{Height of actual building}}</m>
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_bp7kdjw3">
        Scale factor <m>=\frac{0.75}{150}=\frac{1}{200}</m>
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_1xeeki82">
        So, the scale factor is <m>1:200</m>, meaning the model is <m>\frac{1}{200}</m> the size of the actual building. This scale factor ensures that the proportions are similar.
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_pdxsloka">
        (ii) <m>\textbf{Map scale:}</m>
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_tj0meabq">
        Let's say a map is drawn with a scale of <m>1:50,000</m>, meaning <m>1</m> unit on the map represents <m>50,000</m> units in real life. If a road is <m>4\, cm</m> long on the map, how long is the actual road?
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_ja52to5u">
        We can calculate the actual length using the scale factor:
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_4p2v1znq">
        Actual Length = Length on map <m>\times</m> scale factor
    </p>

    <p xml:id="auto_30my3f9l">
        Actual length <m>=4\, cm \times 50,000= 200,000\, cm</m>
