                    Think of a way on how you can represent the movement from point <m>\text{A}</m> to <m>\text{B}</m> using notation, also from point <m>\text{B}</m> to <m>\text{C}</m>.

    <p>
        We can represent a vector by a line drawn between two points 
        as shown in <xref ref="repsentation-vec-1"/> below:

                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta}
                    % Draw an arrow from A to B
                    \draw[|-|] (0,0) -- (4,0) node[right] {Q};
                    
                    % Label points
                    \node[left] at (0,0) {P};
                    
                    % Draw vector
                    \draw [-{Latex[scale=1.5]}] (2,0) -- (2.1,0); 
                \end{tikzpicture}

    <!-- <p>
        In <xref ref="repsentation-vec-1"/>, the direction of
        the vector is indicated by an arrow pointing to the right, while
        its magnitude is determined by the length of <m>PQ</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use <alert>vector notation</alert> to represent a vector between two points.
        Vector <m>\text{PQ}</m> can be written as <m>\underset{\sim}{\text{PQ}}</m> or <m>\overrightarrow{\text{PQ}}</m> or <m>\textbf{PQ}</m>.
    </p> -->
    <!-- <p>
        A vector <m>PQ</m> can be denoted as <m>\underset{\sim}{PQ}</m> or <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m>.The magnitude of vector <m>PQ</m>
        is represented as <m>|PQ|</m>. In this case, we refer to <m>P</m> as <alert>initial point</alert> and <m>Q</m>
        as the <alert>terminal point</alert>
    </p> -->
    <!-- <p>
        Additionally, a vector can also be represented using a single small letter,such as  <m>\mathbf{a}</m> or <m>\underset{\sim}{\mathbf{a}}</m>.
    </p> -->
    <p>
         <alert>Vector notation </alert> is a way of representing quanties that have both magnitude and direction. 
         Vector <m>\textbf{PQ}</m> can be denoted as <m>\underset{\sim}{PQ}</m> or <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> or <m>\mathbf{PQ}</m>.The magnitude of vector <m>\textbf{PQ}</m>
         is represented as <m>|\textbf{PQ}|</m>. In this case, we refer to <m>P</m> as <alert>initial point</alert> and <m>Q</m>
         as the <alert>terminal point</alert>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, a vector can also be represented using a single small letter,such as  <m>\mathbf{a}</m> or <m>\underset{\sim}{\mathbf{a}}</m>.
        In <xref ref="vect-notation-11"/> below, we can represent a vector from a point <m>\text{P}</m> to 
        point <m>Q</m> as <m>\overrightarrow{PQ} = \mathbf{a} = \underset{\sim}{\mathbf{a}}</m>
   </p>
  <!-- <p>
    As well represent a vector from point <m>B</m> to point <m>B</m> we can represent it
      <m>\overrightarrow{BA} = \mathbf{-a} = -\underset{\sim}{\mathbf{a}}</m>
  </p> -->

        \begin{tikzpicture}
          \coordinate (A) at (0,0);
          \coordinate (B) at (6,0);
          \node[left] at (A) {P};
          \node[right] at (B) {Q};
          \draw[thick] (A) -- (B);
          \draw[-{Latex[length=3mm]}] (A) -- (3,0);
          \node[above] at (3,0) { $\mathbf{a}$ or $\underset{\sim}{\mathbf{a}}$};
        \end{tikzpicture}
      </latex-image>
    </image>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Similarly, if the direction of the vector is reversed, from point <m>\text{Q}</m> to point <m>\text{P}</m> 
    the vector is represented as <m>\overrightarrow{QP} = \mathbf{-a} = -\underset{\sim}{\mathbf{a}}</m>
