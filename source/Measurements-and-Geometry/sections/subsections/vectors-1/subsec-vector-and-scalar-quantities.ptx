    <title>Vector and Scalar Quantities</title>
    <p xml:id="auto_gd6qr8s1">
        In our daily lives, we measure many things using just a single number, such as the temperature of a room or the mass of an object. 
        However, for some physical quantities, knowing <q>how much</q> is not enough; we also need to know <q>which way</q>. 
        For example, knowing a hospital is <m>5</m> km away is not helpful unless you also know the direction to travel. 
        This section explores the key differences between quantities that only have <alert>magnitude</alert> and those that have both <alert>magnitude</alert> and <alert>direction</alert>.

                    Imagine it is a normal school day and students are playing football during games time. 
                    Suddenly, one student gets injured and needs to be taken to the nearest hospital immediately.
                    A boda boda rider has agreed to help, but he does not know the way.

                    Your task is to draw a clear and simple map that will guide the boda boda rider from the school to the nearest hospital. 
                    Begin by imagining that you are standing at the school gate and think carefully about the route you would take to reach the hospital. 
                    As you draw the road, show all the turns you would make, whether left, right, or straight ahead.

                    Include at least three landmarks that the rider would see along the way, such as a market, a police station, a church, or a large tree. 
                    These landmarks should be placed in their correct positions to help the rider know that he is on the right path. 
                    Use arrows to show the direction the boda boda should follow and label any roads if you know their names.

                    Finally, look at your map and ask yourself whether someone who has never been in the area could use it to reach the hospital without getting lost. 
                    If necessary, add a compass showing North, South, East, and West to make your directions clearer.
