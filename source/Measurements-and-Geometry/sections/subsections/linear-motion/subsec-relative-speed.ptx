    <title>Relative Speed</title>
    <introduction>

        <p>
            <em><term>Relative speed</term></em> is a simple concept that helps us understand how fast one object is moving compared to another object. 
            It's important because sometimes objects are moving at different speeds, 
            and we need to figure out how quickly they are closing the gap between them or moving away from each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider a case where two bodies moving in the same direction at different speeds. 
            Their <m>\underline{relative \, speed}</m> is the difference between the individual speeds.
        </p>

        <p>
            But if they are moving toward each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.

                            Find a straight line or pathway that is clear and suitable for the race (a hallway, classroom floor, long corridor or outside on a field).

                            Measure out a distance for the race, such as 10 meters. 
                            You can use a measuring tape or use a marked area to set the starting and finishing points.

                        <p>
                            Mark the starting line and the finish line clearly, 
                            so both the toy car and the student know where to start and end.

                            Attach one end of the string securely to the toy car.
                            The other end of the string should be held by a participant or fixed to an anchor (like a pole or sturdy object) so that when the student pulls the string, 
                            the car moves along the line and test the toy car to ensure that it moves easily along the straight path when the string is pulled.

                            You will have two participants: one student (who will walk) and one toy car (which will be pulled by the string).

                            Assign at least one observer to track the race. The observer(s) will help measure the time it takes for each participant (the student and the toy car) to reach the finish line.

                        <p>
                            Place the student and the toy at the starting line. The student should be ready to walk at a constant speed.

                            On the count of "Go!", the student starts walking in a straight line towards the finish line. 
                            At the same time, the person holding the string should start pulling the toy car in the same direction (straight line) at a constant speed. 
                            The toy car should be pulled in a way that resembles a consistent movement, not too fast or too slow.

                            The observers should start the stopwatch as soon as both participants begin moving and stop it when either the student or the toy car reaches the finish line.

                            If you have more than one observer, make sure they agree on the recorded times.

                    A cyclist is riding at a speed of <m>12</m> <em>km/h</em>, and a motorcycle is moving at a speed of <m>20</m> <em>km/h</em> on the same road in the same direction. 
                    If the cyclist starts <m>100</m> meters ahead of the motorcycle, how long will it take for the motorcycle to overtake the cyclist?

                <p>
                    Since the objects are moving in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed by subtracting the cyclist's speed from the motorcycle's speed:

                    Now letes convert relative speed to meters per second, so that we can work with the distance in meters, 
                    we need to convert the relative speed from <em>km/h</em> to <em>m/s.</em>

                    The initial distance between the motorcycle and the cyclist is 100 meters. 
                    To calculate the time it will take for the motorcycle to overtake the cyclist,we have:

                    The first train departs at <m>10:00</m> <em>AM</em>, and the second train departs at <m>11:00</m> <em>AM</em>.

                    Thus, by <m>11:00</m> <em>AM</em>, the remaining distance between the two trains is:

                    The time it takes for the two trains to meet after 11:00 AM is given by the formula:

                    <md>
                        <mrow> \amp = \frac{270\,km}{210\,km/h} </mrow>

                <p>
                    <md>
                        <mrow> \amp = 1.2857\,hours </mrow>
                    </md>
                    This is approximately <em>1 hr and 17 minutes.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the trains will meet at:

                        <mrow>11:00 \text{AM} + \text{1 hour and 17 minutes} \amp = 12:17 \text{PM} </mrow>

                    The cyclists are moving in opposite directions. 
                    The total distance between them after <m>2</m> hours is <m>100</m> <em>km</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the cyclists are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\text{Relative speed} \amp = 20\,km/h + 30\,km/h. </mrow>
                    </md>
                    In 2 hours, the total distance traveled by both cyclists is:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\text{Total distance} \amp = 50\,km/h \times 2\,hours </mrow>

                        <mrow> \amp = 100\,km </mrow>
                    </md>
                    So, the cyclists will be 100 km apart after 2 hours. This confirms the given information.
