             <em><term> Area of part of a circle</term></em> refers to calculating the area of a sector, segment or annulus.
             This is important in real-life because it can be used to calculate the area of a slice of pizza by a baker,
             the area of a slice of cake by a pastry chef, the area of a slice of orange by a fruit seller, 
             the area of a slice of watermelon by a farmer and many more.

                  <shortdescription> image showing a pizza sliced into 8 pieces.</shortdescription>
            </image>
           <p>
             One of the most common applications of calculating the area of a part of a circle is slicing a pizza.
             A pizza is usually sliced into equal pieces, and the area of each slice can be calculated using the formula for the area of a sector.
             This helps in determining how much pizza each person gets and can also be used to calculate the total area of the pizza.
           </p>
           <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    A pizza has a radius of <m>12</m> inches and is sliced into 8 equal pieces. Calculate the area of each slice of pizza.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To calculate the area of each slice of pizza, we can use the formula for the area of a sector:
                    <md>
                        <mrow> A_\text{sector} = \amp \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2 </mrow>
                    </md>
                    where <m>\theta</m> is the central angle of the sector and <m>r</m> is the radius of the circle.
                    Since the pizza is sliced into 8 equal pieces, each slice corresponds to a central angle of <m>\theta = \frac{360}{8} = 45^\circ</m>.
                    The radius of the pizza is given as <m>r = 12</m> inches.
                    Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
                    <md>
                        <mrow> A_\text{sector} = \amp \frac{45}{360} \times \pi (12)^2 </mrow>
                        <mrow> = \amp \frac{1}{8} \times \pi (144) </mrow>
                        <mrow> = \amp 18\times \frac{22}{7} </mrow>
                        <mrow> = \amp 56.57 \text{in}^2</mrow>

                 Another application of calculating the area of a part of a circle is designing a metal washer.
                 A washer is a thin, flat ring used to distribute the load of a threaded fastener, such as a bolt or nut.
                 The area of the washer can be calculated using the formula for the area of an annulus, 
                 which helps in determining the amount of material needed to make the washer and its strength.
              </p>
              <example>
                <statement>
                       <p>
                         A metal washer has an outer radius of <m>5</m> cm and an inner radius of <m>2</m> cm. Calculate the area of the washer.
                      </p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                         To calculate the area of the washer, we can use the formula for the area of an annulus:
                         <md>
                             <mrow> A_\text{annulus} = \amp A_\text{outer circle} - A_\text{inner circle} </mrow>
                             <mrow> = \amp \pi R^2 - \pi r^2 </mrow>
                             <mrow> = \amp \pi (R^2 - r^2) </mrow>
                         </md>
                         where <m>R</m> is the outer radius and <m>r</m> is the inner radius.
                         Given that the outer radius is <m>R = 5</m> cm and the inner radius is <m>r = 2</m> cm, we can substitute these values into the formula:
                        <md>
                            <mrow> A_\text{annulus} = \amp \pi (5^2 - 2^2) </mrow>
                            <mrow> = \amp \frac{22}{7} (25 - 4) </mrow>
                            <mrow> = \amp 21\frac{22}{7} </mrow>
                            <mrow> = \amp 66 \text{cm}^2 </mrow>
                        </md>
                        Therefore, the area of the washer is <m>21\text{cm}^2</m>

                   <p>
                     Another application of calculating the area of a part of a circle is modelling overlapping signal ranges of towers.
                     When two or more towers are located close to each other, their signal ranges may overlap, creating an area where the signals from both towers can be received.
                     The area of this overlap can be calculated using the formula for the area of a segment of a circle, which helps in determining the strength and coverage of the signals in that area.
                  </p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                          <p>
                             Two towers have signal ranges that overlap. The radius of the signal range of the first tower is <m>10</m> km 
                             and the radius of the signal range of the second tower is <m>8</m> km. The central angle of the overlapping area is <m>60^\circ</m>. 
                             Calculate the area of the overlapping signal range.
                          </p>

                              To calculate the area of the overlapping signal range, we can use the formula for the area of a segment of a circle:
                              <md>

                             where <m>A_\text{sector}</m> is the area of the sector formed by the central angle and <m>A_\text{triangle}</m> is the area of the triangle formed by the two radii and the chord of the segment.
                             The area of the sector can be calculated using the formula:
                              <md>

                             where <m>\theta</m> is the central angle and <m>r</m> is the radius of the circle.
                             Substituting the given values, we get:

                            The inner radius of the garden is given as <m>r = 10</m> meters, and the width of the path is <m>2</m> meters, so the outer radius is <m>R = 10 + 2 = 12</m> meters.
                            Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

                            The inner radius of the pool is given as <m>r = 8</m> meters, and the width of the deck is <m>3</m> meters, so the outer radius is <m>R = 8 + 3 = 11</m> meters.
                            Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

                            To calculate the area of each slice of pizza, we can use the formula for the area of a sector:

                            where <m>\theta</m> is the central angle of the sector and <m>r</m> is the radius of the circle.
                            Since the pizza is sliced into 10 equal pieces, each slice corresponds to a central angle of <m>\theta = \frac{360}{10} = 36^\circ</m>.
                            The radius of the pizza is given as <m>r = 14</m> inches.
                            Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

                            The area of the sector can be calculated using the formula:
