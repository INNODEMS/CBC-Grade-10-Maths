    <title>Angles of Elevation and Depression</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            If an architect knows how far away she is from a building, how can she determine its height? By calculating the <term>angle of elevation</term> from her position to the top of the building, she can use trigonometry to find the height. This angle is how far her head must tilt from eye-level to look up at the building.

            Similarly, if she wants to determine the depth of a well, she can calculate the <term>angle of depression</term>, which is how far her head must tilt from eye-level to look down into the well. Both angles of elevation and depression are crucial in various real-life applications, such as architecture, navigation, and surveying.
