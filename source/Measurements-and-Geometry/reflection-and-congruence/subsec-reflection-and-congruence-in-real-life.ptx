                Imagine you are tasked with designing a new garden for your school. Your plan includes creating two identical flower beds positioned on either side of a central pathway. To ensure that the flower beds are congruent and reflect each other across the pathway, you must apply the concepts of reflection and congruence in geometry.

            </p>
            <p>
                To begin, you measure the dimensions of one flower bed and create a detailed sketch. You then reflect this design across the pathway, ensuring that both flower beds maintain the same size and shape. This way, when students walk down the pathway, they will see a beautiful symmetric design that enhances the garden’s aesthetic appeal.

                    Explain why a butterfly's wings demonstrate both reflection and congruence. Identify the mirror line and state which congruence criterion you would use to prove the wings are congruent.

                    A butterfly's body is the mirror line (axis of symmetry). The left wing is a reflection of the right wing across this line. The wings are congruent because corresponding measurements (wingspan, vein patterns, colour patches) are equal. SSS criterion: all corresponding lengths on both wings are equal.
