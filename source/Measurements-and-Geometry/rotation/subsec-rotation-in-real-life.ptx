                Rotation is used in many everyday tools and machines to make work easier and more efficient. In this activity, you will explore how rotation is applied in real-life situations.

                    Identify three everyday objects that use rotation to function (for example, a steering wheel, a water tap, or a screwdriver). For each object:

    <insight xml:id="insight-real-life-rotation">
        <p>
            In practical situations, the <term>centre of rotation</term> is usually a physical feature such as a hinge on a door, an axle in a wheel, or a shaft in a machine. This fixed point or axis allows the object to rotate smoothly and in a controlled manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding both the centre of rotation and the angle through which an object turns is essential in many fields. Engineers use these ideas to design efficient machines, from simple mechanisms like door hinges and bicycle gears to complex systems such as car engines and industrial machinery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scientists also rely on rotational concepts to explain natural phenomena, including the rotation of the Earth and the motion of planets in space.
        </p>

   <example xml:id="example-ferris-wheel">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Suppose a Ferris wheel completes one full rotation every <m>4</m> minutes. If a passenger gets on at the bottom, 
                through what angle will they have rotated after exactly <m>1</m> minute?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                To find the angle of rotation, we must determine what fraction of a full circle the Ferris wheel covers in the given time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A full rotation is <m>360^\circ</m>.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The time for a full rotation is <m>4</m> minutes.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The angle of rotation per minute is <m>\frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ</m>.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, after <m>1</m> minute, the passenger has rotated through an angle of <m>90^\circ</m>.

    <example xml:id="example-gears">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Suppose Gear A has <m>10</m> teeth and is interlocked with a larger Gear B, which has <m>30</m> teeth. If Gear A is rotated one full turn (<m>360^\circ</m>) in the clockwise direction, what is the angle and direction of rotation for Gear B?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                When dealing with gears, the number of teeth determines how much one gear turns relative to the other.

                            <alert>Direction:</alert> Interlocking gears always rotate in opposite directions. Since Gear A rotates clockwise, Gear B must rotate <term>counter-clockwise</term>.

                            <alert>Angle:</alert> Gear B is larger and has <m>3</m> times as many teeth as Gear A (<m>\frac{30}{10} = 3</m>). This means Gear B will only complete <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> of a rotation for every full rotation of Gear A.
                        </p>

                The Earth completes one full rotation (<m>360^\circ</m>) approximately every <m>24</m> hours. Through what angle does the Earth rotate in an <m>8</m> - hour period?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We can find the angle by calculating the rate of rotation per hour.

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A full rotation of <m>360^\circ</m> takes <m>24</m> hours.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Angle of rotation per hour <m>= \frac{360^\circ}{24} = 15^\circ</m>.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To find the rotation for an <m>8</m>-hour period, we multiply the hourly rate by <m>8</m>:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>15^\circ \times 8 = 120^\circ</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Earth rotates through an angle of <m>120^\circ</m> during an <m>8</m>-hour school day.
