    <introduction>
        <p>
            Surface area is a fundamental geometric concept with many practical uses. Engineers use surface area to calculate heat transfer and cooling rates; manufacturers rely on it for coating, painting, or material estimates; architects and landscapers use it when planning cladding, tiling, or irrigation coverage; and scientists use surface area to model reactions that occur at interfaces (e.g., catalysis or evaporation). Understanding how to compute surface area lets you accurately size materials, predict performance, and control costs across a wide range of real-world applications.
