    There is an online course to provide teachers with resources to help teaching CBE-aligned Grade 10 mathematics, and create a forum for teachers to share resources and experiences on the delivery of the Kenyan Grade 10 math. It includes ready-to-use example lesson plans aligned with CBE, as well as more detailed step-by-step lesson guides aligned with CBE. By using the forums, you can gain a certification. We will also provide links at the start of each sub-topic in this section to the specific resources for that sub-topic.
