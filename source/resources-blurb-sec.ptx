    There is an online course to provide teachers with resources to help teaching CBE-aligned Grade 10 mathematics, and create a forum for teachers to share resources and experiences on the delivery of the Kenyan Grade 10 math. It includes ready-to-use example lesson plans aligned with CBE, as well as more detailed step-by-step lesson guides aligned with CBE. By using the forums, you can gain a certification. 
    We will also provide links at the start of each sub-topic in this section to the specific resources for that sub-topic.

    You can access the course directly using the link below, or follow <dataurl source="lesson-plans/MoodleApp guide.pdf">this guide</dataurl> to install the Moodle App to more easily follow the course on your phone.
