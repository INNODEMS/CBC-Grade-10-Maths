            <url href="https://innodems.github.io/CBC-Grade-10-Maths/student">Click here</url> for an (online) student version of the book. Share this with students (or their parents) who have access to digital devices. It features interactive <term>Checkpoint</term> questions that students can use to practice at their own pace and get instant feedback on their solutions. These questions are randomized, so that students can attempt a question multiple times and get a different random variant each time. This mechanism is also useful for teachers to generate questions e.g. for a test.

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p>
            This is an interactive digital textbook following the Grade 10 Kenyan competency
            based maths curriculum. For each strand (topic), it contains interactive questions, called 
            <term>Checkpoint</term>s, that students can use to practice their understanding
            of the strand. These checkpoints provide instant feedback on the student's answer,
            and can be attempted multiple times as each time a new variant of the question will
            be generated. Thus it is an ideal resource for students to practice at their own pace.

            Below you can find an example of a checkpoint question. While in print these look like regular exercises,
            in the online version these are interactive. Students can enter their answers in the input fields and get immediate feedback.
            They can also attempt new random variants of the questions to practice a given concept over and over.
