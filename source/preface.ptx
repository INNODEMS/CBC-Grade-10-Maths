        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p>
            This is an interactive digital textbook following the Grade 10 Kenyan competency
            based maths curriculum. For each topic, it contains interactive questions, called 
            <term>Checkpoint</term>s, that students can use to practice their understanding
            of the topic. These checkpoints provide instant feedback on the student's answer,
            and can be attempted multiple times as each time a new variant of the question will
            be generated. Thus it is an ideal resource for students to practice at their own pace.
